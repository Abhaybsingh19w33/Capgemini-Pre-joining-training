SUCCESS OF JAVASCRIPT -> BROWSER (CLIENT SIDE)
JavaScript was invented to add interactivity ti web application (client side).

Web browsers support only HTML and JavaScript

HTML is used to develop User Interface for web applications.

JavaScript is used to add behaviour and interaction to the UIs of web applications.

JavaScript is well supported by all major browsers.

JavaScript is used to enhance user-experience on the browsers (web-based apps).

Examples: JavaScript usage
Mikekus.com: Portfolio designer
HelloMonday.com: Digital graphics and animation
Multeor.com: Multiplayer game
Crimetimeline.io : Crime data in Britain
Hereistoday.com: Ilustrates the scale of time on Earth
Tweetmap.com: Tweets around the world
Sidigital.io: Portfolio and blog

SUCCESS OF JAVASCRIPT -> WEB SERVERS (SERVER SIDE)
Server-Side JavaScript (SSJS) implementation has become popular for the developmetn of server side apps.

Example 1
Node.js uses V8 engine (Google) to build fast and scalable network applications.

It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, which is perfect for data-intensive, real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

Example 2
Rhino.js is a CommonJS-based JavaScript runtime written in Java. It is based on the Mozilla Rhino JavaScript engine.

Rhino.js, which runs on the Java VM, provides a rich set of modules that covers blocking and asynchronous 1/0, logging, persistence and development tools.

Example 3
Narwhal is a cross-platform, multi-interpreter, general purpose JavaScript platform.

It aims to provide a solid foundation to build JavaScript applications, primarily outside the web browser.

Example 4
Wakanda is an "end-to-end" JavaScript platform based on the SquirrelFish JavaScript engine that provides REST API for Server-Side JavaScript object persistence and a client-side object browser.

SUCCESS OF JAVASCRIPT -> BEYOND THE BROWSER
libmozjs-24-bin package comes with Mozilla's SpiderMonkey engine. It can be used as an interactive interpreter(using JS24 command).

libv8-dev package provides Google's V8 engine.

Node.js is available as the executable Node.js.JIT compilation is provided as a courtesy of V8.

libjavascriptcoregtk-3.0-bin uses WebKit's JavaScriptCore interpreter (JSC) as a regular interpreter from the command-line.

SUCCESS OF JAVASCRIPT -> SUMMARY
Key points discussed in this video:
-> JavaScript can be used to create non-browser apps using JavaScript libraries.

-> JavaScript is used for the development of interactive client side apps.
