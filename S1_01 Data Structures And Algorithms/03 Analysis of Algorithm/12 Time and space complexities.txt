ALGORITHM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN

Define resource Analysis
List the types of resouce analysis
Describe time and spacce complexity measures

Analysis of an algorithm:
This refers to forcasting the resources consumed in terns of how much of the primary memeory algorithm consumes or how much the algorithm takes in executing the steps of program.

Complexiy of an algorithm
This represents quantity of resouces consumed during execution. The primary resources are time and space.

Time complexity
-> the analysis of how much the time taken by the algorithm
-> Total execution time is deroived from 

// here i in opi is instances
->opi(n) is the total number of instances of operation opi and ti is the time taken to execute each instance of the operation.

The time complexity is expressed in terms of operation count or step count.

Operation count
-> The OC iss one way to estimated the time complexity which measures the exact number of operations required to complete the algorithm.

Step count is another way to estimate time complexity
-> Step count is detailed estimate which computes the total number of basic operations perfromed at  every single step in unit time.

Space complexity
The analysis base on the space required by the algorithm
It is expressed in terms of 
instruction space - that is the space needed to store the executable code in the memory.

Data Space - The space required to store the variables and constants in the memory

Environment stack space -  The space consumed during function calls

For Searching an element in an array, what is the operation count estimate of time complexity?
Initializing the array
Reading the array
Number of search operation
Displaying whether the element is found or not

-> Number of Search operations
