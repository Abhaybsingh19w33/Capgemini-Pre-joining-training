List different algorithm design techniques
Identify the algorithms in various design techniques

-> There are 2 types of analysis of algorithms: 

--> priori - analysis before the execution, in these we ignore the machine and platform dependent factor influencing the algorithms and coled algorithm consumption time and space

requires the knowledge of mathematical equations to analyse the step count 

--> posteriori analysis - analysis after the execution, external factor like network latency, hardware delay etc. mayy infuence analysis

Profiler tool can be use dto peform a posteriori analysis

Profiling referss to the process of measurement of spacce and time complexities of a program

Profiler tool is used for a priori analysis. true or false.
True
false

-> False
