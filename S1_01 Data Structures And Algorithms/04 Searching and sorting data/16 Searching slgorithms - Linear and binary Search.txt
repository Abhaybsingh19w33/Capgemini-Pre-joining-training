Searching refers to finding whether a data item is present in the set of items or not.

The time required to search depends on the following factors:
-> Whether the data is arranged in a particular order or not
-> The location of the data to be searched
-> The total number of iterations to be carried
out to search the data

Linear Search
-> Linear search is applied on the set of items that are not arranged in any particular order
-> In linear search, the searching process starts from the first item
-> Searching continues either till the item is found or till the end of the list is reached indicating that the item was not found
-> Items in the list are assumed to be unique

Binary Search
-> A binary search is a searching technique that can be applied only to a sorted list of items
-> Binary search technique is similar to
dictionary search

Find the mid element of the array:
-> Compare the mid element with the item to be searched
--> If the mid element is equal to the item to be searched, Item found in the array
--> If the item to be searched is less than the mid element, recursively perform the binary search on the elements till the mid element
--> If the item to be searched is greater than the mid element, recursively perform search on the elements after the middle element

Step 1: Set First 0 and Last = Number of Items - 1
Step 2: Find the middle of the list as mid = (First+ Last) /2. Take only the intege part, if the result is a real number.
Step 3: Compare the middle item with the searching item. If they are equal then "Item is found"
Step 4: f the searching item is less than the middle item then the searching item comes before this middle element. So set Last= mid -1 and there is no change in the value of First.
Step 5: Since the above conditions are false the searching element should be greater than the middle element. So set First mid +1 and there is no change in the value of Last.
Step 6: If First <= Last then go to step 2 to find the middle element
Step 7: Since end of the list is reached, the searching item is "not found" in the list.
Step 8: End of the algorithm

Linear search
-> Can be applied on sorted and  unsorted list of items
-> Searching time is more

Binary search
-> Can be applied only on sorted list of items
-> Searching time is less

Key points discussed in this video:
-> Searching is an operation which is frequently used in data processing.
-> Linear search is a sequential search where the key elements iteratively checks each element till the element is found,
-> Binary search searches the element from a  data set which is sorted.
