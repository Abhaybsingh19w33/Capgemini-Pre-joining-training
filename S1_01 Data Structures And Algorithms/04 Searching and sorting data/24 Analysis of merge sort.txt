Time complexity of the merge sort algorithm

Merge sort is represented as T(N) = 2*T (N/2) + N

Expanded version of this equation: T(N) = N*T(N/N) + N + N + N ...+ N

n(logn+1) repetitions

Combining, the worst case complexity of merge sort algorithm = O(nlogn)

Merge sort uses the concept of divide and conquer

List of elements is broken down into two halves, and the sorted arrays are merged back together
