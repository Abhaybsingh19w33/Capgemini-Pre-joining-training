Algorithm Design techniques
Brute force
Divide and conquer
Decrease and conquer
Greedy
Dynamic programming


Brute force algorithm (linear search, selwction sort, bubble sort)
Straight forward approach to solve a problem
Directly based on problem statement
One of the simplest algorithm designs to implement

Divide and Conquer
problem divided into smaller sub-problems
Each sub problem solved independently
Solutions of the sub problems combined to get to solution

Decrease and conquer technique (This techniques establises  relation between given bigger instance of the problem and smaller instance of the problem)
Problem can be solved either top-down or bottom-up
Variants : Decrease by a constant, Decrease by a constant factor and variable size Decrease

Greedy Desin technique (this technique is primarily used in optimization problems which helps in constructing  a problem to a sequence of steps where each step considered a partial solution which is extended progressively to get the complete solution)

the choice at each step is based on the step beibg either feasible, locally optimal or irrevocable.




Brute force technique follows each alternative to solve the problem.
Decrease and conquer decreases the peobelm size bya constant and then solves the problem
greedy technique aims at providing an optimal solution
