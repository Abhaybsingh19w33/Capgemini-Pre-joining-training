List the types of algorithmi instructions
Describe the life cycle of an algorithm


A step-by-step proces for solving the problem needs to be defined.

Properties of an algorithm:
Expilicit unambiguos finite number of steps
Known inputs
Generated output
treminates in a fixed amount of time


Phases of algorithm:
Analyse
Design
Write
Test

Types of instructions in an algorithm:
Sequential
Conditional 
Iterative


An algorithm is a step by step procedure to solve a problem on a fixed amount of time.

An algorithm is an explicit unambiguous finite number os steps.

Sequential, iterative and conditional are the types of algorithmic instructions.
