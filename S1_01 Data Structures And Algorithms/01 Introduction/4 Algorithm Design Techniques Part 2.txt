Activity Selection Problem
Dynamic programming

Activity selection problem (it is an slight variation of the problem of scheduling a resource among several competing activities) here we use greedy approach

Dynamic programming - Used to solve problems with overlapping sub-problems. It solves the problem by combining  the sub- problems.

It is vey similar to Divide and conquer

Diffrence between Dynamic programming and divide and conquer

Divide and conquer technique considers every sub problems as disjoints while the dynamic programming considers them as overlapping.

Example 
M1 : (10, 20)
M2 : (20, 50)
M3 : (50, 1)
M4 : (1, 100)

-> M1 * (M2 *( M3 *M4))

if applying recursive normal multiplication

Operation       Multiplications Total
M3*M4           50*100          5000
M2*(M3*M4)      20*50*100       100000
M1*(M2*(M3*M4)) 10*20*100       20000
                                125000 <- total

then applying dynamic programming
Operation       Multiplications Total
M3*M4           20*50*1         1000
M2*(M3*M4)      10*20*1         200
M1*(M2*(M3*M4)) 10*1*100        1000
                                2200 <- total

The dynamic programming technique is used to solve problems with overlapping sub-problems.
