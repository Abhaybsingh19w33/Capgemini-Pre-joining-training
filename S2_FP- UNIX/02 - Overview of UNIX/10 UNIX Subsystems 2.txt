UNIX KERNEL SUBSYSTEM II > VIRTUAL FILE SYSTEM
-> Common Interface for accessing files
-> Buffer Cache
-> Encapsulates various device drivers

UNIX KERNEL SUBSYSTEM II > NETWORK STACK
-> Layered architecture
-> Interface for networking protocols
-> Managing internetwork connections

UNIX KERNEL SUBSYSTEM II > DEVICE DRIVERS
-> Major part of UNIX Kernel
-> Make hardware usable by the software
-> One driver for each device

UNIX KERNEL SUBSYSTEM II > SUMMARY
Key points discussed in this video:
-> Virtual File System provides a common abstraction layer over all types of UNIX files.
-> Network Stack is the heart of internetworking capabilities of a UNIX system.
-> Device Drivers are the basic Kernel modules that help programs interact with hardware devices.
