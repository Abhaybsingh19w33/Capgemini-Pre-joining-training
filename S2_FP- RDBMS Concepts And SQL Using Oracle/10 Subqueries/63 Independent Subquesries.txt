Introduction
This lecture introduces us to the usagge of independent subqueries.

Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this module, you will be able to:
-> Use various independent subqueries in SQL.

1. Types of Independent Subqueries

Independent subquery is executed independent of the main query. In this case, subquery executes only once irrespective of the number of rows fetched by the main query.

Single-row Subquery

Following query retums employees working in IT department.

SELECT First_name ||' '|| Last_name AS Full_Name,
Department_id deptid,
hire_Date FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT
department_id FROM departments
WHERE department_name= 'IT');

FULL_NAME           DEPTID      HIRE_DATE
Alexander Hunold    60          03/01/06
Bruce Ernst         60          21/05/07
David Austin        60          25/06/05
Valli Pataballa     60          05/02/06
Diana Lorentz       60          07/02/07

Note that equality operator is used as single-row subquery operator. Depending on the query other comparison operators like >, < etc. can be used as well.

Following query returns details of employee earning highest salary.

SELECT First_name ||' '|| Last_name AS Full_Name, salary,
hire_Date
FROM employees
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX (salary) FROM employees);

FULL NAME       SALARY      HIRE_DATE
Steven King     24000       17/06/03

Multiple-row Subquery

Following query retrieves all employees working in USA.

SELECT first_name, last_name, job_id, salary FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments
WHERE location_id IN (SELECT location_id FROM locations WHERE country_id ='US'));

Independent subquery is executed independent of the main query. In this case, subquery executes only once irrespective of the number of rows fetched by the main query.

Multiple-column Subquery

When a subquery contains more than one column in the query it is a multiple-column subquery.

Following query retrieves all employees earning same as minimum salary offered for the job of Clerk.

SELECT first_name, job_id, salary
FROM employees
WHERE (job_id, salary) IN ( SELECT job_id, min_salary FROM jobs
WHERE UPPER (job_title) LIKE '%CLERK%');

FIRST NAME      JOB ID      SALARY
Karen           PU_CLERK    2500
Martha          SH_CLERK    2500
Randall         SH_CLERK    2500

Following query retrieves employees earning top 5 salaries using subquery in the FROM clause.

SELECT last_name, salary
FROM (SELECT first_name, 1ast_name, salary, department_id
FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC) empl
WHERE rownum <= 5
ORDER by rownum;

King        24000
Kochhar     17000
De Haan     17000
Russel      14000
Fartners    13500

(Note: ROWNUM is a pseudocolumn which acts like a serial number in the output)

2. Summary
-> A single-row subquery is a subquery which returns only one row.
-> A multiple-row subquery is a subquery which returns multiple rows.
-> A multiple-column subquery is the one which contains more than one column in it.
