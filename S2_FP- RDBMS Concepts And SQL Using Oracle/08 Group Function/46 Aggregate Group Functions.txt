Introduction
This module introduces us to the usage of aggregate functions.

Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this module, you vwill be able to:
-> Use various aggregate functions in the SQL.

1. Aggregate functions

A number of aggregate functions built into SQL Group functions are also known as group functions. Group functions are evaluated on groups of one or more rows that are retrieved.

COUNT (DISTINCT/ALL <column name>) counts the number of rows in the query. By default ALL is taken.

COUNT(*) returns all the rows returned by the query even if there are NULL values in the table.

COUNT(<Column name>) counts the number of rows returned by the query while in this case, rows with NULLs are not counted.

COUNT(DISTINCT <column names>) returns the count of the distinct rows returned by the query.

MAX and MIN functions returm maximum or minimum value in case the argument is numeric, and returns latest or earliest date in case the argument passed is of date datatype.

AVG function returns the average of the rows for a particular column that is passed.

SUM function returns the total of the rows for a particular column that is passed.

AVG, SUM, MAX and MIN ignore NULL value.

DISTINCT can be used with AVG and SUM functions.

Following query uses COUNT aggregate function:

SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(employee_id), COUNT (commis sion_pet), COUNT (DISTINCT department_id)
FROM employees;

Output of the above query is as shown below:

COUNT(*)    COUNT(EMPLOYEE_ID)      COUNT(COMIISSION_PCT)       COUNT (DISTINCT DEPARTMENT_ID)
107         107                     35                          11


Following query uses AVG, SUM, MAX and MIN aggregate functions:

SELECT ROUND (AVG (salary), 2), SUM (salary),
MAX (hire_date), MIN (salary)
FROM employees;

AVG (SALARY)    SUM(SALARY)     MAX(HIRE _DATE)     MIN (SALARY)
6461.83         691416          21/04/08            2100

2. Summary
Here are the key takeaways:

-> Group functions are evaluated on groups of one or more rows that are retrieved
-> Group functions in a SELECT statement without a GROUP BY clause, considers all the rows retrieved by the query as a single group
