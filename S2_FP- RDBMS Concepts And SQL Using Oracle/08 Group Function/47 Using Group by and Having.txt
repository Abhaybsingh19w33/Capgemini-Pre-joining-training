USING GROUP BY AND HAVING CLAUSES -> INTRODUCTION

Aggregate Functions

Summarizes data and provides one result
-> average, max and min

Requires additional clause to mention in the Select statement to take the average

USING GROUP BY AND HAVING CLAUSES -> GROUP BY CLAUSE

GROUP BY clause
-> Aggregates functions, act on multiple rows and return a single value

Need an additional GROUP BY clause
-> GROUP BY is used in conjunction with aggregate functions to group resulting rows by specified columns

Syntax
SELECT <column_name(s)>,
aggregate_function(<column_name>)
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <condition>
GROUP BY <same column_name(s)>;

Illegal GROUP BY Queries
-> Any column or expression in the SELECT list used along with aggregate function must be in the GROUP BY clause

USING GROUP BY AND HAVING CLAUSES -> HAVING CLAUSE

HAVING clause
-> Cannot use WHERE clause to restrict groups
-> No aggregate functions can be Used for Comparison purposes in the WHERE clause
-> WHERE clause is applied first, and then the aggregation in the HAVING clause
-> Used to restrict groups in the GROUP BY clause
-> Used with aggregate functions

HAVING Clause Syntax
SELECT <column_name(s)>, aggregate_function(<column_name>)
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <column_name> <operator> <value>
GROUP BY <same_column_name(s)>
HAVING aggregate_function(<column_name>) <operator> <value>;

USING GROUP BY AND HAVING CLAUSES SUMMARY
Key points discussed in this video:
-> The GROUP BY clause is used in conjunction with the aggregate functions to group the resulting rows by specified columns
-> WHERE clause cannot be used to restrict groups; instead HAVING clause should be Used for this purpose
