WORKING WITH AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS -> INTRODUCTION

Single-row functions
-> Help us to transform the data from every row of a table

Aggregate functions
-> Act on a group of rows
-> Applies certain aggregation and gets a single result

What is Aggregation?
-> To 'aggregate' means to collect, summarize, accumulate   

Example: Sum, Maximum, Minimum, Count

BOOK_TYPE       MAX_COST        COUNT
PR              8500            9
DB              7000            12
NW              12200           5

Aggregate function returns one result or one value

-> Act on multiple rows and return single value
-> Can appear in SELECT lists and in ORDER BY and HAVING clauses
-> Commonly used with the GROUP BY clause in a SELECT statement
-> In such cases, aggregate functions can be applied to each group
-> If there is no GROUP BY clause, Oracle applies aggregate functions in the select list to all the rows in the queried table

WORKING WITH AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS -> USAGE
Examples
General examples of aggregate functions
-> Sum of numbers
-> Average salary
-> Maximum mark
-> Minimum amount
-> Count of employees

Important and frequently used aggregate functions in Oracle:
AVG()       -> Returns the average value
COUNT()     -> Returns the number of rows
MAX()       -> Returns the largest value
MIN()       -> Returns the smallest value
SUM()       -> Returns the sum

WORKING WITH AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS -> SUMMARY
Key points discussed in this video:
-> To 'aggregate' means to collect, summarize and accumulate
-> The different aggregate functions are AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN and SUM
-> Aggregate functions process multiple rows and return single value
