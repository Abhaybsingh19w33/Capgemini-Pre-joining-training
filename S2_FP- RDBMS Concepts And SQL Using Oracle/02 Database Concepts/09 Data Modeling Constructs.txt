DATA MODELING CONSTRUCTS INTRODUCTION
Database Design
-> Database design is the initial phase of the software application development

Advantage of data modeling
-> Provides diagrammatic representation of data and its relationship among the data

ER Modeling Constructs

Entity
-> Object in the real world with an independent existence
-> Can be tangible or intangible
E.g. customer (tangible); car, acco0unt (intangible)

Entity Type
-> Collection of entities with same attributes
E.g. employees of HR dept., telecom subscribers and cars of a particular brand

Entity Instance
-> Member of the entity type
E.g. Pupil tree (Instance of Tree)

Entity Relationship
-> Association between two or more entities
E.g. car owners (relationship between customers and cars)

Attributes
-> Description about the entity
E.g.car model, car manufacturing year, etc.

Types of Attributes

Simple Attribute
-> Cannot be divided into simpler components of application programs
E.g. employee number

Composite Attribute
-> Can be split into multiple components
E.g. employee name, address, etc.

Single-Valued Attributes
-> Can take only a single value for each entity instance
E.g. department name

Multi-Valued Attributes
-> Can take up many values
E.g. employee skill set

Stored Attribute
-> Can be stored permanently

Derived Attribute
-> Can be calculated based on other attributes
E.g.age

DATA MODELING CONSTRUCTS -> ER MODELING CONSTRUCTS
ER modeling is a diagrammatic representation of the database design

Notations
-> Entity
--> Rectangle

-> Weak Entity
--> Double walled rectangle

-> Relationship
--> Diamond

-> Identifying Relationship
--> Double walled diamond

-> Attribute
--> Ellipse

-> Key Attribute
--> Ellipse with underscore

-> Multi-Valued Attribute
--> Double ellipses

-> Composite Attributes
--> Group of attributes

-> Derived Attributes
--> Dotted Ellipse

Relationships
How to establish relationship using that R?

-> No entity is independent in any ER model

-> Single connection
--> Partial participation of E1 in R

-> Double connection
--> Total participation of E2 in R

Cardinality

1-N
N-1
N-N

(Min, Max) - settting limit to cardinality from min to max participation

Types of Entities
-> Regular
--> Independent existence

-> Weak
--> Dependent on regular entity

DATA MODELING CONSTRUCTS -> TYPES OF ENTITIES
Relationship - set of all associations between the entity types

Relationship instance - each instance of the relationship between members of entity types

2 different types of relationships
-> Total Participation
--> All instances need to participate

-> Partial Participation
--> All instances need not participate
