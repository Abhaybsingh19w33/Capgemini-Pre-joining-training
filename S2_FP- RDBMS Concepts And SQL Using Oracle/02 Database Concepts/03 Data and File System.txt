DATA AND FILE SYSTEM -> DISADVANTAGES OF FILE SYSTEM

-> Security of data
--> Multiple users can inadvertently make changes to data

-> Data redundancy
--> Information of a single customer must not be duplicated in case of multiple accounts

-> Ensuring isolation
--> Transactions done in savings accounts need to be done separately in isolation to ensure that there is no mix up of data between multiple transactions and accounts

-> Program/data dependence
--> Data should be in a particular format so that it can be processed by program at any time

-> Inflexibility of data formats
--> Format of data is fixed and it cannot be updated to the existing requirement

-> Access issues
--> Multiple users cannot access the data simultaneously

DATA AND FILE SYSTEM -> SUMMARY

Key points discussed in this video:

-> Data is a fact or a collection of facts from which conclusions may be drawn
-> Data might get lost if it is not managed properly
-> While managing data in file system, it is not Secure and there is lot of data redundancy
