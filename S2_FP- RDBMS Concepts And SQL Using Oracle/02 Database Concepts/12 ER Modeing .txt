E-R MODELING STEPS -> INTRODUCTION
Database Design
-> E-R Modeling
--> Used to define and capture relationship between two entities

E-R MODELING STEPS DEGREE OF RELATIONSHIP
Unary relationship
-> One entity is related to another entity

Binary relationship
-> Two entities are related to another entity

Ternary relationship

Relationship may also have attributes

E-R MODELING STEPS STEPS IN E-R MODELING
-> Identify entities (typically nouns in the requirement statements)
-> Find relationships (typically verbs)
-> Identify key attributes for every entity
-> Identify other relevant attributes
-> Draw complete E-R diagram with all attributes including primary key
-> Review your results with the end-users
-> Refine it further, if required

Converting strong entity types
-> Each entity type becomes a table
-> Each single-valued attribute becomes a column
-> Derived attributes are ignored
-> Composite attributes are represented by its equivalent parts
-> Multi-valued attributes are represented by a separate table

E-R MODELING STEPS -> PROS AND CONS OF E-R MODELING
Advantages/Pros of E-R Modeling

-> Is intuitive and helps in physical database creation
-> Is diagram-oriented
-> Is easy to understand for business users
-> Can be generalized and specialized, based on business needs
-> Can help in database design
-> Gives a higher level description of the system
-> Helps clear ambiguities in the requirements

Cons of E-R Modeling
-> Physical design derived from E-R model may have some ambiguities or inconsistencies
-> Diagrams may lead to misinterpretations

E-R MODELING STEPS -> SUMMARY
Key points discussed in this video:

-> Degrees of relationship are Unary, Binary, and Ternary
-> Steps involved in E-R model - identify entities, find relationships, identify key attributes, identify relevant attributes, draw E-R diagram with primary key, review results with end users, and refine if required
-> Pros- understandable, intuitive, generalized, specialized, helps clear ambiguities, gives higher level description of system
-> Cons- may lead to inconsistency, misinterpretations in physical design
