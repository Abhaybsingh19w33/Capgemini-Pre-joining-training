DATA MODEL - THREE SCHEMA ARCHITECTURE FEATURES OF RDBMS
-> What data is stored in the database?
--> DBMS helps to manage data properly
--> Data required for programs is stored in the database
Eg : Money transaction details of a bank

Data stored in database is determined by end user

DATA MODEL -THREE SCHEMA ARCHITECTURE INTRODUCTION
Consider the example of a bank
Data that needs to be stored:
-> Customer's basic information
-> Customer's account information
-> Customer's transaction and interest calculation details

Interact with relevant people to collect appropriate data

Eg : 
Manager 1 - Savings related activities
Manager 2 - Loan related activities
Manager 3 - Recurring deposit related activities


DATA MODEL - THREE SCHEMA ARCHITECTURE THREE SCHEMA ARCHITECTURE

External Schema A
External Schema B 
External Schema C
-> Perspective of end-users
-> External/View Level (Individual User View)
        ^
        |
Conceptual Schema
-> Information from manager on savings-related activities and related data
-> Perspective of database designer
-> Conceptual Level (Common User View)
        ^
        |
Internal Schema
-> Specific to a particular technology or database
-> Perspective of technology
-> If implementation is in Oracle, Oracle-specific syntax to be used to create internal schema
-> Internal Level (Storage View)
        ^
        |
Database


Three important characteristics of the database approach:
Installation of program and data
-> Can independently write program without considering format of data

Supports multiple users views

Data Dictionary a catalogue to store DB description

DATA MODEL -THREE SCHEMA ARCHITECTURE SCHEMA
What is schema?
-> Description of a database specified during database design, represented as a schema diagram

Example of a schema diagram:
Customer
-> Cust_no
-> Cust_name
-> Cust_type
-> Cust_phone 
-> Address

Product
-> Prod_no
-> Prod_name
-> Prod_desc
-> Prod_price

Order
-> Order_no
-> Cust_no
-> Prod_no
-> Ord_date
-> Ord_gty

External Schema
End-user perspective
-> Data such as account number, branch code, and balance

Conceptual Schema
Internal Schema
-> Captures same set of details in a different format
CREATE TABLE Savings AC Acct_no NUMBER (20), Branch_cd_NUMBER (10), Balance NUMBER (20, 2)

Database
-> acct no
TYPE = BYTE (20), OFFSET = 0 
branch_cd_TYPE = BYTE (10), OFFSET = 20 
balance TYPE = BYTE (20), OFFSET = 30

DATA MODEL THREE SCHEMA ARCHITECTURE TWO LEVELS OF DATA INDEPENDENCE

Data is inflexible in a file system

Logical Data Independence
-> Capacity to change conceptual schema without changing external schema

Physical Data Independence
-> Capacity to change internal schema without changing Conceptual schema
-> Changing offset without impacting conceptual schema 


DATA MODEL - THREE SCHEMA ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY
Key points discussed in this video:

-> Three layers of database architecture-External View Level, Conceptual Level and Internal Level
-> Two levels of data independence- Logical Data Independence and Physical Data Independence
