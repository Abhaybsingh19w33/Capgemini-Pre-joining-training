SINGLE-ROW FUNCTIONS INTRODUCTION

Database

-> Change data in the database
-> Retrieve data from the database

Book Title can be long and if the programmner wants to display only the first 25 characters of Book Title -> Use DB, PR and OS

Example:
Book Title
Book Cost
Book Type

ORACLE Oracle provides single row function

SINGLE-ROW FUNCTIONS -> SQL FUNCTIONS

What are the SQL functions?
-> SQL functions are in-built in Oracle database
-> SQL functions help to transform data

Categories of SQL Functions
-> Single-row Functions
--> Return a single result for every row of a queried table
--> Appear in SELECT lists, WHERE clauses, START WITH and CONNECT BY, and HAVING clauses

-> Aggregate Functions
--> Return a single result rOw based on groups of rows
--> Can appear in SELECT lists, ORDER BY and HAVING clauses

-> Analytic Functions
-> Object Reference Functions
-> Model Functions
-> User-defined Functions

SINGLE-ROW FUNCTIONS -> TYPES

Numeric
E.g. ROUND, FLOOR, CEIL, ABS

Character
E.g. UPPER, LOWER, LENGTH

DateTime
E.g. MONTHS_BETWEEN, NEXT_DAY

Conversion
E.g. TO_CHAR, TO_DATE, TO_NUMBER

Other types
E.g.Collection, Data mining

SINGLE-ROW FUNCTIONS -> CONTROL EXPRESSIONS

Control Expressions
Enable IF ... THEN ... ELSE logic in SQL statements without having to invoke procedures

Example:
-> Book Type - DB PR
-> Database displays if the Book type to DB, PR and OS

Provide SWITCH-CASE kind of functionality (like in C programming)

Execute the logic for every selected row

Can returna default option if there is no match

Return NULL if there is no default option

Different control expressions of single-row functions:
-> DECODE
-> CASE
-> Searched CASE

SINGLE-ROW FUNCTIONS -> SUMMARY
Key points discussed in this video:

-> SOL functions are in-built in Oracle and help to transform data

-> Categories of SQL functions are Single-row functions Aggregate functions, Analytic functions, Object Reference functions, Model functions and User-defined functions

-> Single-row functions return a single result for every row of a queried table

-> Aggregate Functions return a single result row based on groups of rows

-> Control expressions are used to include some processing logic within the SQL statements
