CREATING AND MANAGING DATABASE TABLES -> INTRODUCTION
-> Create the ER model
-> Convert the ER model into equivalent physical schema and create tables

How to create the tables?
-> Data definition language

CREATING AND MANAGING DATABASE TABLES ->  DDL STATEMENTS

CREATE
-> Creates the specified object
-> Objects in Oracle are table, view, index, sequence etc.

ALTER
-> Changes the specifications, attributes and other characteristics of an object after it has been created
-> ALTER table, ALTER View, ALTER index etc.

TRUNCATE
-> Can be specified for a table or a cluster
-> Erases all records or rows from the object while retaining its original structure
-> Cannot undo this operation
-> Removes the table completely from the database

COMMENT
-> Used in documentation
-> Used to insert some text description about the object

RENAME
-> Changes the name of objects like table, view etc.

Impact created by the DDL statement is high
-> Many database applications and other systems may depend upon the database

All DDL statements cause an implicit commit
Example:
Once the administratorS update or delete a file in a database, the administrators can create the DML which gets implicitly committed

Only database administrators (DBA) and users with such privileges can issue DDL statements in the database environment

Developers
-> Do not issue any DDL statement
-> Focus mainly on the DML
-> Interested in storing the data and retrieving the data

CREATING AND MANAGING DATABASE TABLES -> FLASHBACK TABLE
Flashback Table
-> Flashback is the ability to recover a table to a specified point in time or SCN

System Change Number (SCN)
-> Stamp that defines a Committed version of a database at a point in time

-> Oracle assigns every committed transaction a unique SCN

Flashback 
-> Changes are made to a table
-> Need to visit the previous versions of the table

Flashback Table
-> Reduces the effort for point-in-time recovery operations and is faster than backup and recovery mechanism

-> Flashback table is much faster
-> Restores the table while automatically maintaining the associated attributes such as indexes, triggers and constraints

-> Restores the table back to its past state as per
the SCN or time specified

-> FLASHBACK TABLE SQL statement is used with a target time or SCN to flashback the Table

Flashback Table
-> To restore Books_Hist table to a year back:
FLASHBACK TABLE books_hist
TO TIMESTAMP (SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1' YEAR);

Book on January 1st, 2015 -> Book on January 1st, 2014

-> Restore it to the previous version

-> Accidentally dropped book can be rescued using FLASHBACK TABLE


To retrieve Books table that was dropped accidentally
FLASHBACK TABLE Books TO BEFORE DROP;

Use RENAME clause to rename retrieved table if Books table already exists:
FLASHBACK TABLE Books TO BEFORE DROP RENAME TO Books_old;

For FLASHBACK to work, ROW MOVEMENT must be enabled on the table:
ALTER TABLE Books ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT;


CREATING AND MANAGING DATABASE TABLES -> SUMMARY

Key points discussed in this video:

-> CREATE statement creates the specified object
-> ALTER statement is used to modify structure of an object
-> DROP statement removes the object from the database completely
-> FLASHBACK SQL restores the table to a specified point in time or System Change Number (SCN)
