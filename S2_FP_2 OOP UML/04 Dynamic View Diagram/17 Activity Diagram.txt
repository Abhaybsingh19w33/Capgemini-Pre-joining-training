ACTIVITY DIAGRAM -> PROCESS FLOW
Process flow/work flow
-> Gives us the steps of the process of any functionality to be achieved
-> Is represented by writing flow charts
-> Is represented by writing activity diagram in UML

ACTIVITY DIAGRAM -> INTRODUCTION

Activity Diagram
-> Is a behavioural diagram of UML
-> Can be written either at the analysis or design phase
-> Is used to represent process or work flow
-> Is written at the behavioural view

ACTIVITY DIAGRAM -> ACTIVITY DIAGRAM ESSENTIALS
An Activity Diagram
-> Starts with an initial node.
-> The initial node represents the starting point of the diagram.
-> It is represented by a filled circle.
-> It ends with a final node.
-> The final node represents the ending point of the diagram.
-> It is represented by a bull's eye.
-> In between the initial and the final node, are actions.
-> Actions represent the steps that are taken in an activity.
-> Actions are represented by rounded rectangles.

In activity diagram
-> The flow of the activity is shown using arrowed lines called paths.
-> The diamond box represents the decision symbol.
-> The vertical or horizontal parallel lines are called SWimlanes.

ACTIVITY DIAGRAM -> ACTIVITIES AND ACTIONS

Actions
-> Actions are the steps in completion of a process.
-> Activity is the process, which is being modeled.
Example: Applying for leave
-> Action is a step in the overall activity, such as taking the leave form, filling the leave form and more.

ACTIVITY DIAGRAM -> DECISIONS AND MERGES
Decisions are used when we have to execute a different set of actions, based on a condition.

The branched edge of the decision symbol containsa guard condition written inside a bracket.

ACTIVITY DIAGRAM -> DECISIONS AND MERGES

Concurrency
-> Is parallel processing, where many actions have to take place together for us to complete an activity
-> Is represented by Synchronisation bars

-> In our leave application process, to grant leave, the two processes of checking the work load and checking the leaves available, should happen in parallel.

ACTIVITY DIAGRAM -> TIME EVENTS
Time Event
-> Used to represent a waiting period
-> Used to represent schedule jobs
-> Represented by an hour glass symbol
-> For example:
Taking backup of data once in 24hrs and biling process of any service, where the waiting period will be for 30 days

ACTIVITY DIAGRAM -> SWIMLANES AND PARTITIONS
Swimlanes
-> Are the logical partitions in an activity diagram, which represent roles or groups
-> Are used when different groups or departments are needed to complete an activity
-> Are used to show who is responsible for what actions
-> In our registration system, for the registration process to get completed, we need registration system and billing system.
-> These two systems can be represented as two swimlanes.

ACTIVITY DIAGRAM -> MANAGING COMPLEX ACTIVITY DIAGRAM
-> Complex diagrams can be managed by using connectors.
-> Connectors can be used to manage complex diagrams, which grow beyond a page.
-> Connectors are represented as empty circles.
