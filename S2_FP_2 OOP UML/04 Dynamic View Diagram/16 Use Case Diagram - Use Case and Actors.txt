USE CASE DIAGRAM: USE CASES AND ACTORS -> USE CASE DIAGRAM
Let's understand the use case diagram by taking a case study of Student Registration system.
-> It gives us a list of functionalities to be implemented.
-> The functionalities would be discussed as we unfold the process of learning use case diagram.

USE CASE DIAGRAM: USE CASES AND ACTORS -> OVERVIEW

Use case diagram is made up of related model elements.

Model Elements
-> Use Case
-> Actor

USE CASE DIAGRAM: USE CASES AND ACTORS -> OVERVIEW
What is a use case?
-> A use case is any functionality or requirement of the system.
-> A use case is represented as an ellipse.

What is an actor ?
-> An actor is an external entity, which falls outside the boundary of the system.
-> An actor is represented as a stick man.

What all can fall under the category of an actor?
An actor can be
-> an end user
-> any other organisation, system or sub-system
-> any data repository area

Types of Actors
-> Primary Actor
--> A primary actor is one who is responsible for triggering the functionality.
--> For example: Student, professor

-> Secondary Actor
--> A secondary actor communicates with the system and there will be information exchange. Secondary actor does not trigger any functionality.
--> For example: Data repository
