-> It supports and encourages parallel activities
-> It is important for business modelling

-> Understanding workflow across different use cases

Swimlane helps us in modelling the workflow of the business process to partition the activity states into groups. Each group is called a swimlane

Summary
Here are the key takeaways

-> Activity diagrams are used for workflow modelling.
-> An activity diagram replaces a flow chart
-> Activity diagrams provide the following extra features when compared to flowch arts:
--> Concurrency (fork and join)
--> Swimlane
