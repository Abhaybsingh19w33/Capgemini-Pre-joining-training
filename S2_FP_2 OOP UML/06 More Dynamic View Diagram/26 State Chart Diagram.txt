STATE CHART DIAGRAM -> STATE
State
-> Every object has a state.
-> State is the value of the properties of the object at a given instance of time.
-> Objects can get into more than one state during its life time.
--> For example: The 'pass and fail' state of a student
-> Whenever the objects change the state, at least a few of the behaviours of the object will surely change.

STATE CHART DIAGRAM -> DYNAMIC BEHAVIOUR
-> Changing behaviour of an object is called as dynamic behaviour.
-> Dynamic behaviour is modelled by using state chart or state transition diagram.

STATE CHART DIAGRAM -> PURPOSE
State Chart Diagram
-> Is a behavioural diagram
-> Is written to capture the changing behaviour of an object or the entire system
-> Can be written either at the analysis or at the design phase

STATE CHART DIAGRAM -> ESSENTIALS
State chart diagram has four essential elements.

State chart diagram

States
-> The value of property of an object at any given instance of time

Transitions
-> External events which push the object from one state to another

Dynamic behaviour
-> Behaviour of an object that is shown in a particular state

Initial and final states
-> Pseudo states, which represent the starting and ending point of state chart diagrams

STATE CHART DIAGRAM -> CAPTURING DYNAMIC BEHAVIOUR
Dynamic behaviour can be captured at four different instances of time.

On Entry
-> Behaviour is captured when an object enters a particular state

On exit
-> Behaviour is captured when an object exits a particular state

entry until exit
-> Behaviour is captured as long as an object stays in a particular state

On event
-> Behaviour is captured on an event

STATE CHART DIAGRAM -> STATE TYPES
States are of three types.

States

Simple state
-> A state that does not contain any sub-states.

Composite state
-> A state, which contains either sub-states or is divided into orthogonal regions

Sub-state
-> A state machine into which a composite state is decomposed

STATE CHART DIAGRAM -> TRANSITION TYPES

Types of Transition

Simple Transition
-> Transition occurring between the source and target state

Return Transition
-> The source and target states are the same state (transition to self)

Local Transition
-> Transition indicating transitions between any sub-states of a composite state

External Transition
-> Transition leaving a composite state and directed to another state or pseudo-state

Complex Transition
-> Chain of transitions joined or forked, linked by a junction or decision node

Automatic Transition
-> Transition without any associated event or condition

STATE CHART DIAGRAM -> BUILDING A STATE CHART DIAGRAM
-> Identification of objects, whose dynamic behaviour has to be captured
--> Identification of possible states of a state machine
---> Determination of the hierarchy of states, sub-states and orthogonal regions
----> Linking the states and their Sub-states with transitions
-----> Application of adequate pseudo-states
