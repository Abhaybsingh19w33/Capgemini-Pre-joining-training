GETTING STARTED WITH METHODOLOGY AND ITS TYPES METHODOLOGY
What is a Methodology?
-> Methodology is an approach that is taken to solve a problem.
-> A problem can be solved by different approaches.
-> Every methodology has got its own advantages and disadvantages.
-> A methodology is chosen based on one's requirement.
For example: SSAD, OOAD

GETTING STARTED WITH METHODOLOGY AND ITS TYPES -> USES OF METHODOLOGY
A methodology
-> Helps us understand a problem better
-> Helps us change our perception of looking at a problem and findinga solution to it
-> Helps us solve the problem in smaller chunks

GETTING STARTED WITH METHODOLOGY AND ITS TYPES TYPES OF METHODOLOGY
Types of Methodology
-> SSAD: Structure System Analysis and Design
-> OOAD: Object Oriented Analysis and Design

SSAD:
-> Stands for Structured System Analysis and Design
-> Is a function centric methodology

The problem statement in SSAD is
-> Analysed via a function
-> Designed via a function
-> Implemented via a function

GETTING STARTED WITH METHODOLOGY AND ITS TYPES -> SSAD AND ITS APPLICABILITY

SSAD and Its Applicability
-> In SSAD, every requirement mentioned is assumed as a function.
-> The solution is designed in the form of a function.
-> The implementation of the solution is done via a function
-> The basic building block or structural element of SSAD is a function.
-> All structured programming languages, such as C, Pascal and COBOL follow SSAD.

OOAD:
-> OOAD stands for Object Analysis and Design 
-> The basi building block or structural element od OOAD is an object and a class 

Object
Class

Object
-> Analyse the problem statement
-> Design the solution
-> Implement the solution

GETTING STARTED WITH METHODOLOGY AND ITS TYPES -> WHEN TO APPLY METHODOLOGY?
-> Any methodology that is followed, has to be applied at the beginning of our SDLC.
-> We need to start using the methodology from the Requirements Engineering Phase itself.
--> Requirements Engineering Phase
