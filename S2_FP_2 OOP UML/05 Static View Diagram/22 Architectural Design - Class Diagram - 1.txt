ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN: CLASS DIAGRAM -> CLASS DIAGRAM

The whole process of writing the class diagram is divided into 3 steps.
-> Identify the classes
-> Design the classes
-> Set the relationship among the classes

Identify the classes
-> Identify classes based on sequence diagram:
--> Search for repetitive objects and identify a class for it.

Identify the classes
-> Identify classes based on use cases, which is referred to as Use Case Analysis:
--> Identily 3 classes per use case: Based on verbs
---> 1 user service, 1 business service, 1 data service
--> Identify 1 class per actor: Based on noun
--> Visit use case description and identify 3 classes per flow (alternate and exception flow, if any).
--> A sum of all this is called ALC (Analysis Level Classes).

Identify the classes
-> From the list of ALC, remove unwanted classes:
--> Remove repetitive classes
--> Remove classes, which have no functionality
-> ALC gets divided into Good and Bad classes.
-> Good classes will be designed.
-> Bad classes will be excluded.

Designing the classes include 4 steps.
-> Identity the attributes of the class
-> Identity the behaviour of the class
-> Attach access specifiers
-> Attach stereotypes


Design the classes
-> We apply the concept of abstraction to identity the attributes and behaviour of the class.
-> Knowing the purpose of having the class will help us identify the attributes and behaviour.

Design the classes
-> Attaching the access specÃ­fiers
--> The class members are divided into private, public and protected sections.
--> Private is represented by '-' symbol.
--> Public is represented by '+' symbol.
--> Protected is represented by '#' symbol.

Design the classes
-> Attaching stereotypes
--> Stereotypes can be attached to classes.
---> For example: Form, control, entity, table, Java Script and more
--> Stereotype can be attached to member function of the classes.
---> For example: Implementer, Manager, Access Helper
