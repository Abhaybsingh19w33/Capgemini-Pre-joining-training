To execute the c program in linux

-> g++ filename.c

-> ./a.out

-> g++ -g filename.c -o filename(any)  - this will create a executable file with name of filename(any).out

-> ./filename(any) - to execute the file

To debug c code in linux

-> g++ -g filename.c

-> gdb a.out

gdb commands

--> l - to list program (show code in terminal)

--> b linenumber - to set breakpoint at that line

--> r - to run the program till the breakpoint

--> info b - info about the break point

--> n - next line of program to be executed (in appropriate sequence of running of code)

--> n numberOfLines - next numberOfLine of program will be executed (in appropriate sequence of running of code)

--> (if function appers, and n command is passed then it will run the function and return the output, we will not be able to debug the function)

--> s - it was used to step into the function (this is to enter the function and debug the function)

--> p variableName - to print the value of variable

--> print variableName - to print the value of variable

--> q - to end the gdb

javap co.vinod.entity.Product // to print member variables

javap -private co.vinod.entity.Product // to also print private members

While using packages , if a package path is declared in the class, to which the class belongs to 

to create the dir path thorugh command line

-d  -  indicates we have to create directory structure for the package

.  indicates current working directory

it can be replaced with any directory (Eg    ../bin)

javac -d . *.java


you can use f7 as a shortcut in cmd to list previous commands

we can also set classpath for compiler to look for all .class files in this classpath

set classpath=%classpath%; //  if the classpath is already been set you use that
set classpath=PATH;

//. means look for all the classes in the current working directory
; it is used as seperator
c:\temp - look any class in the temp folder
set classpath=.;c:\temp

in eclipse terminology it ic called buildpath
