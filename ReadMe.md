gdb commands 

--> l - to list program (show code in terminal)

--> b linenumber - to set breakpoint at that line

--> r - to run the program till the breakpoint

--> info b - info about the break point 

--> n - next line of program to be executed (in appropriate sequence of running of code)

--> n numberOfLines - next numberOfLine of program will be executed (in appropriate sequence of running of code)

--> (if function appers, and n command is passed then it will run the function and return the output, we will not be able to debug the function)

--> s - it was used to step into the function (this is to enter the function and debug the function)

--> p variableName - to print the value of variable
