CLOUD SECURITY > RISKS IN CLOUD COMPUTING

-> Cloud acts as a big black box, nothing inside the cloud is visible to the clients.

-> Clients have no idea or control over what happens inside a cloud.

-> System admins may tamper with the VMs and violate confidentiality and integrity.

-> Cloud is also prone to traditional data confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy issues.

Cloud security problems arise due to:
-> Loss of control
-> Lack of trust (mechanisms)
-> Multi-tenancy

These problems exist mainly in third party management models

CLOUD SECURITY -> DATA SECURITY
-> Physical security denotes controlling physical access to the servers that support your infrastructure.

-> When selecting a cloud provider, it is important to understand physical security protocols offered by the cloud provider.

Some of the key data control challenges are:
-> your data can be accessed on someone else's servers

-> your cloud provider declares bankruptcy and ceases operations

-> your cloud provider fails to secure portions of its resulting in security breach

Data-in-transit:
-> Confidentiality and integrity using secured protocol
-> Confidentiality with non-secured protocol and encryption

Data-at-rest
-> Encryption if it is not associated with applications
-> Indexing and searching

CLOUD SECURITY -> NETwORK SECURITY
-> Ensuring confidentiality and integrity of your organization's data-in-transit to and from your public cloud provider

-> Ensuring proper access control to resources at your public cloud provider

-> Replacing the established model of network zones and tiers with domains

CLOUD SECURITY> CLOUD SECURITY CONTROL
-> Cloud security control primarily helps in addressing, evaluating and implementing security in the cloud.

-> The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has created a Cloud Control Matrix (CCM), which is designed to help prospective cloud buyers evaluate a cloud solution's overall security.

Types of cloud security controls:

Deterrent Controls:
-> Serve as warning to a potential perpetrator of an attack.

Preventive Controls:
-> Used for protecting the vulnerabilities within a cloud.

Corrective Controls:
-> Help reduce the after-effects of an attack.

Detective Controls:
-> Used to detect an attack


CLOUD SECURITY -> WS SECURITY
Web Services (WS) Security:
-> provides integrity, confidentiality and authentication for SOAP messages

-> defines a SOAP header (Security) that carries the WS-Security extensions

-> defines how existing XML security standards like XML Signature and XML Encryption are applied to SOAP messages

How does it operate
-> XML Encryption allows XML fragments to be encrypted to ensure data confidentiality.

-> The encrypted fragment is replaced by an EncryptedData element containing the ciphertext of the encrypted fragment as Content.

-> XML Signature allows XML fragments to be digitally signed to ensure integrity or to proof authenticity.

The signing process works as follows:
-> The Signedinfo element is canonicalized
and signed.

The result of the signing operation is placed in the SignatureValue element and the Signature element is added to the security header.

CLOUD SECURITY > SUMMARY
o Cloud is also prone to traditional data confidentiality, integrily availability, and privacy issues.

o Companies face data security challenges with data-in-transit, data-at-rest, and during data processing.

o Network security requires ensuring proper access control to resources at your public cloud provider.

o Cloud Control Matrix is aimed to help prospective cloud buyers evaluate a cloud solution's overall security.

o WS Security defines how existing XML security standards like XML Signature and XML Encryption are applied to SOAP messages.
