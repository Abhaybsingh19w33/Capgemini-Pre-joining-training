Introduction
CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE MODELS -> CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE
-> A cloud infrastructure is the collection of hardware and software that enables cloud computing.

-> The cloud infrastructure contains both a physical layer and an abstraction layer.

-> Physical Layer hardware resources that are necessary to support the cloud services being provided

-> Abstraction Layer - software deployed across the physical layer


CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE MODELS > MODELS OF CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE
Infrastructure as a Service (laaS)

Self-Provisioning
-> The consumer can deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications.

Management and Control
-> The consumer does not manage the cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications

Delivery 
-> IT infrastructure is delivered as off-premises, on-demand services rather than as dedicated.

Providers
-> Amazon (AWS)
-> RackSpace cloud, CloudCompute and
-> Bizcloud
-> Microsoft (Azure)

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
What does it offer?
-> The consumer can use consumer-created or acquired applications on cloud infrastructure.

What does the consumer control?
-> Consumer has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.

Software as a Service (SaaS)
What does it offer?
-> The vendor supplies software and the hardware infrastructure to the consumer via multiple interfaces.

What does the consumer control?
-> The user has control over user-specific application configuration settings.

Example:
Google Pack includes web applications such as, Calenda, Gmail, Google Talk, Docs, etc

Hierarchical Relationship: laas, PaaS, Saas

SaaS
-> Application Software
-> Access from anywhere
--> PaaS
---> Information
---> Messaging
---> Connectivity
-----> laaS
-------> Network Devices
-------> Servers
-------> Storage

Cross Concept Matrix
IaaS
-> Paradigm shift
--> Infrastructure as an asset

-> Characteristics
--> Usually platform independent; infrastructure costs are shared; SLAS; pay by usage; self-Scaling

-> Key Terms
--> Grid computing, utility computing, compute instance, hypervisor, cloud bursting. multi-tenant computing. resource pooling

-> When not to use
--> When capital budget is greater than operating budget

-> Advantages
--> reduced ROl risk; low barriers  to entry; streamlined and automated scaling

-> Disadvantages
--> Business efficiency and productivity largely depends on the vendor's capabilities; centralization requires different security measures

Paas
-> Paradigm shift
--> License purchasing

-> Characteristics
--> caters to agile project management methods

-> Key Terms
--> Solution stack

-> When not to use
-> N/A

-> Advantages
--> Streamlined version deployment

-> Disadvantages
--> Centralization requires new/different security measures

Saas
-> Paradigm shift
--> Software as an asset (Dusiness and consumer)

-> Characteristics
--> SLAs; Ul powered by thin-client applications communication via APls; stateless; loosely coupled; modular, semantic interoperability

-> Key Terms
--> Thin client; client-server application

-> When not to use
-> N/A

-> Advantages
--> Lack of capital expenditure on software and development resources; reduced R0l risk; streamlined and iterative updates

-> Disadvantages
--> Centralization of data requires new/different security measures


CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE MODELS> PUBLIC CLOUD VS PRIVATE CLOUD

Comparison: Public Vs Private

Private Cloud
-> Is used by a single organization
-> May be managed by the organization or a third party
-> Is consumed by multiple consumers - business units
-> May exist on or off premises

Public Cloud
-> Is for open use by general public
-> may be managed by a business, academic, or government organization, or some combination of them
-> exists on the premises of the cloud provider

COMPONENTS OF CLOUD CcOMPUTING -> HYBRID CLOUD
A combination of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures:
-> Private
-> Community
-> Public

-> Private & public cloud remain unique entities
-> Public & private cloud are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology for seamless flow of data and applications
-> Example: Cloudbursting

COMPONENTS OF CLOUD cOMPUTING -> ADVANTAGES OF HYBRID CLOUD
Hybrid Cloud:

-> Leverages the scalability and cost-effectiveness of a public cloud offering, without exposing critical data to external resources

-> Provides the best of both worlds while optimizing the use of infrastructure resources

-> Helps companies overcome issues and Concerns related to security and compliance

COMPONENTS OF CLOUD COMPUTING> SUMMARY

o laS, Paas, and SaS are diferent cloud infrastructure models.
o When capital budget is greater than operating budget, laaS should not be used.
o While Private cloud infrastructure is used exclusive by a single organization, Public cloud is operated tor open use by the general public.
o In a hybrid cloud, the public & private cloud are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology.
