Polymorphism
Polymorphism provides a single interface to different types of entities

Polymorphism (Greek term)
-> Poly means many
-> Morphs means form
--> Different forms of same object

Types
There are three types of Polymorphism:
-> Ad hoc
-> Parametric
-> Subtyping

Ad hoc Polymorphism
Ad hoc is about function or operator overloading

Example:
String add(String firstName, String lastName)
int add(int num1, int num2)
Date add(Date source, int number of Days)

Operator Overloading
Redefining the behaviour of an operator is called as an operator overloading

Example

Employee scott, miller;

Function    Case 1              Case 2          Operator redefined
add         scott += "Ross"     scott += 500.0  +=
Comparing   scott> miller       Scott> 6500.0   < or >

Parametric Polymorphism
-> In Java and C sharp the function or datatype of parametric Polymorphism is called as generics
-> In C++ it is called templates
-> Allows a function or a data type to be written generically
-> It can handle values identically without depending on their type

Subtyping Polymorphism
-> Also known as inclusion Polymorphism, it involves a super type subtype relationship
-> Subtyping always overides a method from the supertype

Summary
-> Polymorphism provides a single interface to different objects
-> There are three types of Polymorphism
-> Subtyping subtype always overrides a method from the super type
