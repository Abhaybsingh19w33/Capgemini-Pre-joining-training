Introduction
-> Inheritance allows a subclass to inherit the properties from a parent class

IS-A relationship
-> IS-A relationship is the foundation for Inheritance
-> It represents hierarchy between two classes

(Base class/Super type of B) Object A ---> Extension of A ---> (Derived/Subtype of A) Object B

Features
-> An object of a subclass has all the implementations of the super class
-> Emphasises on code-reusability in programming languages
-> Allows independent extensions of the original software

Types
-> Single Inheritance
-> Multiple Inheritance
-> Hybrid Inheritance
-> Muitilevel Inheritance
-> Hierarchical Inheritance

Single Inheritance
-> A single Inheritance subclass inherits the features from only one superclass
-> Java allovws only single Inheritance

Multiple Inheritance
-> Allows a class to have more than one supper class to inherit features from all parent class
-> C++ supports this, but Java and C sharp don't support this

Multilevel Inheritance
-> A subclass is inherited by another class at multiple levels
-> Java, C#, C++ support this

Hierarchical Inheritance
-> Every superclass is inherited by more than one subclass (at-least two)

Hybrid Inheritance
-> Combination of different types of Inheritance

Method Overiding
-> Subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super classes

Method Overriding: Features
-> The version of a method that is executed will be determined by the object that is invoking it
--> Same name
--> Same parameter or signature
--> Same return type as the method in the super class

Method Overriding: Languages
-> Java can override and prevent overriding using keyword
Methods             ->       Keyword used in Java
Force overriding    ->       abstract
Prevent overriding  ->       Final

IS-A vs HAS-A Composition Inheritance
-> IS-A and HAS-A are hierarchies and are used for code reusabilityy

Correct statement
Computer <-- Laptop is a computer <-- Laptop --> Laptop has a processor --> Processor

Wrong statement
Computer <-- Laptop has a computer <-- Laptop --> Laptop is a processor --> Processor

Summary
-> Inheritance is how a subclass can inherit properties from the superclass
-> IS-A and HAS-A are hierarchies and are used for code reusability
-> 3 There are five types of Inheritance
