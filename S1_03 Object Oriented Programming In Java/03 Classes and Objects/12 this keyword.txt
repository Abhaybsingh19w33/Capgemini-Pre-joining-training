Overview
In Java, 'this' is a reference to the object in context (current object)

It can only be used inside:
-> Non-static methods
-> Constructors

Introduction
When a method is called using an object reference, the same is supplied as an implicit parameter to the method, with the name 'this'

this' Keyword
-> When an instance method is invoked, the reference of
the invoking object is passed to the invoked method

-> It is passed as the first (invisible) argument and
received by the reference 'this

this' Keyword: Uses
Used in a constructor or a method to refer to a member variable

Example:

class Employee {
    int id;
    public void setId (int id) {
        this.id = id; // ID is the same variable as a parameter as well as the member
    }
}

-> The 'this' keyword can also be used to invoke a constructor from another one 
-> 'this' is merely to transfer control and reuse the code

Example
class Employee {
    int id;
    String dept;
    double salary;

    Employee (int id) {
        this.id = id;
        this("ADMIN" , 20000.0);
    }

    Employee (String dept, double salary) {
        this.dept = dept;
        this.salary = salary;
    }
}

Points to Remember
this
-> Can never be null
-> Can not be used to access static variables, since static variables do not belong to the object
