Q - Which of the following is not a major element in OOP?
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Typing
Hierarchy

Ans - The four major elements of OOP include
Abstraction, Encapsulation, Hierarchy, and
Modularity.

Q - In case of ______________ object continues to exist even after its creator ceases to exist.

Encapsulation
Typing
Persistence
Modularity

Ans - Persistence is the property of an object through
which its existence transcends time and hence
the object continues to exist even after its creator
ceases to exist.

Q - Abstraction ______________ on details that are significant to the viewer.

emphasises
suppresses
ignores
Ans - Abstraction presents an object's view relative to the perspective of who is using it

Q - Encapsulation is generally used for

Hiding the data members

Emphasizing on the details that are significant to the viewer

Presenting an object's view relative to the perspective of who is using it

Ans - Encapsulation is the mechanism for restricting access to Some components of an object, and hence hide the data members which are accessed via public methods.

Q - In a UML class diagram, encapsulated members are prefÄ«xed with the symbol.

Plus
Minus
Hash

Ans - Encapsulated members are denoted as private and hence we use the minus symbol to the same in a UML class diagram.

Q - Which of the following does not describe aggregation?

Composition
Overriding

Method overloading
Constructor overloading

Ans- Overloading of operators are not allowed in Java, unlike C++ or C#.

Q - Which of the following is also known as inclusion polymorphism?
