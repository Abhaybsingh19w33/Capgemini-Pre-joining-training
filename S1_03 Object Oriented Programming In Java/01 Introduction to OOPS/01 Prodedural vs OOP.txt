PROCEDURAL VS OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
Introduction
-> Programming paradigm is the way to write the programs
-> Every programming pattern has its on Paradigm

Object Oriented Programming
Procedural Programming

Procedural Programming
-> Derived from structural programming
-> Follows top-down approach
-> Emphasises modular programming
-> Based on procedural calls

Procedures
-> A procedure contains steps of an algorithm
-> Common application languages available in the segment are C, Fortran, BASIC and Pascal
--> Routines
--> Subroutines
--> Functions
--> Methods

Object Oriented Programming
-> Paradigm based on the concepts of objects
-> Groups data and related procedures inside the object
-> Emphasises on reducing complexity and increasing code reusability, maintainability

Object
-> Object stores data in the form of variables
-> Also known as fields, attributes or properties
--> Code that operate on the data in the form of functions
--> Function in an object will access only the data member of that object

Design Pattern
"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"

-> A book by Gang of Four (GOF), 1995
-> Explores the advantages and downfalls of OOP
-> Describes common 23 programming problems and patterns for solving them
-> Each problem solution combination was known as a design pattern
