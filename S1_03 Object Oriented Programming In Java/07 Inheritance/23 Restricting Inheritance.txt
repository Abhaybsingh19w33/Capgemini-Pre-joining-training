Introduction
Inheritance is a very powerful object-oriented feature

Restrict from being Wrongly used -> Might get some wrong results
Final classes cannot be inherited -> Complete flexibility and control

Overview
-> final keyword on a class makes the class non-extendable
-> final keyword can be used with a method with a variable

if a class is declared as final it does not mean
--> References are final
--> Members are final

Only it means the class can not be used as a super class

Final class
Example of a final class:

public final class Television extends product {
    // members
}

The keywords public and final can exchange their places:

final public class Television extends product { 
    // members
}

Final class
The compiler would give error if Television class is extended

public class FlatTelevision extends Television {
    // members
}

Compiler error: cannot inherit from final Television

API classes
Java API has many final classes:

-> java.lang.System Class is marked as final
-> Represent some class
-> java.lang.String is very powerful and most widely used    

Disadvantages of Final Class
-> Use of 'final' keyword on a class, stops the idea of code reusability
-> Classes may not be able to inherit the features of a powerful classes
-> Use composition instead of inheritance

-> Final classes are used when a class is supposed to be immutable
-> An object whose state or values cannot be changed is called immutable object

Final Classs
-> String class is immutable, any of its methods does not change the original value

-> If String class is not final; then it can be passed to doSomething()

-> Immutable class ensures that calling any function does not result in any harm

class Test {
    void doSome thing (String str){ 
        // ...
        str.toUpperCase ();
        // ...
    }
}

-> String class is marked as final, so there is no subclass of String class

Abstract and Final
-> An abstract class can not be used for creating an object
-> To realise an object, create a subclass and an object of that subclass
-> The keywords abstract and final cannot be applied on a single class

abstract encourage inheitance

final discourage inheritance

Summay

-> Final keyword is used in a class to stop inheritance
-> String class defines final
-> The keywords abstract and final cannot be together
