DESIGN AND SYSTEM LOGICAL ARCHITECTURE DEFINITION OF DESIGN

Design
-> The third phase of SDLC, where the solution is thought of.
-> The phase where the question how' is addressed.
-> Gives us the specification or the plan of the system.

DESIGN AND SYSTEM LOGICAL ARCHITECTURE -> LEVELS OF DESIGN
There are two different levels of design.

Levels of Design
-> High Level Design
--> Design the system at higher level of abstraction
-> Low Level Design
--> Design each and every atomic component of the system

DESIGN AND SYSTEM LOGICAL ARCHITECTURE > TYPES OF DESIGN
There are 4 different types of design.
Types of Design
-> Architectural Design
-> Procedural Design
-> Data Design
-> Interface Design

DESIGN AND SYSTEM LOGICAL ARCHITECTURE -> ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN
Architectural Design
-> It is the process of setting the relationship among the structural elements of the system.
-> It gives the system specification and plan.
-> It is represented by writing class diagram in OOAD.

DESIGN AND SYSTEM LOGICAL ARCHITECTURE -> DESIGN CONCEPT
There are two design concepts, which help us in architectural designing.

Design Concept
-> Coupling
-> Cohesion

Coupling
-> Coupling is the level of dependency among the structural elements of the system.
-> A good system is the one, which is loosely coupled.
-> For example: Nested or inner classes

Cohesion
-> Cohesion is the integrity of a single structural element.
-> A good system is the one, which is highly cohesive.
-> For example: A professor user service class

Types of Cohesion
-> Functional
-> Coincidental
-> Sequential
-> Logical
-> Communicational
-> Temporal
-> Procedural

Functional
-> In a functionally cohesive module, all the parts of the module work together towards achieving a single task.
-> For example: A class, which is dedicated to user interaction (professor class)

Sequential
-> In sequential cohesive module, the parts of the module are grouped, as the output from one part is the input to the other.
-> For example: A class, where the get and set functionalities are grouped into one module

Communicational
-> In communicational cohesive module, the parts of the module are grouped, as all the functions of the module refer or update the same data.
-> For example: A class, where both get and set methods are referring to the same data

Procedural
-> In procedural cohesive module, parts of the modules are grouped because they always follow some sequence of execution.
-> For example: A Class Get Set method is grouped, where we accept the data from the end user and then set the data

Temporal
-> In temporal cohesive module, the parts of the module are grouped based on when they are processed.
-> For example: A multitasking or a multithreading function

Logical
-> In logical cohesive module, the parts of the module are grouped, as they are logically categorised to work together.
-> For example: Grouping all print related functions, even though the outputs are different

Coincidental
-> In coincidental cohesive module, the parts of the module are grouped arbitrarily.
-> For example: Utility class

DESIGN AND SYSTEM LOGICAL ARCHITECTURE -> PROCEDURAL DESIGN
Procedural Design 
-> Procedural design is writing the procedure for the requirements identified.
-> Procedural design is represented by writing sequence or communication diagram in OOAD.

DESIGN AND SYSTEM LOGICAL ARCHITECTURE -> DATA DESIGN
Data Design
-> Data design is the data repository design.
-> Data design is represented by writing Class diagram in OOAD.

DESIGN AND SYSTEM LOGICAL ARCHITECTURE -> INTERFACE DESIGN
Interface Design
-> Interface design is designing the interface component, which helps two other components to interact with each other.
-> Interface design does not have any specific representation.
