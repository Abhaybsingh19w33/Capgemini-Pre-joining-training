ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN: CLASS DIAGRAM -> RELATIONSHIPS
Setting the relationships among the classes
-> Objects are related to each other to enhance reusability and shareability.
-> There are 5 relationships that can be set.

Relationships
-> Association
-> Realise
-> Aggregation
-> Gen/spe
-> Dependency

Setting the relationships among the classes
Association
-> It is set between any two unrelated classes that can use each other's data.
-> It can be unidirectional or bidirectional.
-> It is the weakest form of relationship.
-> It is a temporary relationship.
-> It is represented by a filled line with an arrow head or just a filled line.

Setting the relationships among the classes
Association
-> Association-Multiplicity or cardinality
--> Allows us to specify the set of elements than be accessed

Multiplicity        Option
1 1                  Every one element can access one element.
1 2...5              Every one element can access anywhere betweer 2 to 5 elements.
1 3,7                Every one element can access either 3 or 7 element.

Setting the relationships among the classes
Association
-> Association -Association class
--> Is a class, which comes into existence because of the association relationship between two classes

Setting the relationships among the classes
Aggregation
-> It is the implementation of 'has a' relationship.
-> It has an outer and an inner object.
-> The outer contains the inner object.
-> The inner object loses its significance, if taken out of the outer object.
-> It is represented by a straight line with empty/filled rhombus head.

Setting the relationships among the classes
Dependency(dotted line)
-> It can be set between two unrelated classes.
-> It can be either unidirectional or bidirectional.
-> It is represented by a dotted line with an arrow head.

Setting the relationships among the classes
Gen/Spe (Inheritance) generalization/ specialization
-> It is theimplementation of is a' relationship.
-> In this, there is a base and a derived class.
-> The derived class extends the base class.
-> It is represented by a solid line with a triangle head.

Setting the relationships among the classes
Realise
-> It is set between a class and an interface.
-> A class realises an interface.
-> An interface can be realised by many classes.
-> A class can realise one or more interface.
-> It is represented by a dotted line with a triangle head.
