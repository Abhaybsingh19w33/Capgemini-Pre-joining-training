-> We were able to see complexity only in terms of identifying anf managing data.
-> This led us to data modeling

DATA MODELING AND ITS USES
-> Data modeling is the process of identifying the data required by our system and designing the same
-> Data Modeling gives us only 20% of the entire information

data modeling
-> Logical data modeling
-->  Helps us identify the data required and represent them

-> Physical Data Model
--> Helps us design the data repository
