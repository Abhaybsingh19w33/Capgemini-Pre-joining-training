POLYMORPHISM -> INTRODUCTION
Polymorphism = many forms
-> It provides a single interface to different types of entities.

POLYMORPHISM -> OVERVIEW
-> Greek term (Poly + Morph)
-> Many forms
-> Provides single interface to entities of different types

POLYMORPHISM -> TYPES
The three types of Polymorphism are:
-> Ad hoc
-> Parametric
-> Subtyping

POLYMORPHISM -> AD HOC
Function Overloading:
-> int add(int num1, int num2)
-> String add(String firstName, String lastName)
-> Date add (Date source, int numberOfDays)

POLYMORPHISM -> AD HOc
-> Operator Overloading:

Employee scott, miller;
scott+= "Ross
scott += 500.0
scott> miller
scott> 6500.0

POLYMORPHISM -> PARAMETRIC POLYMORPHISM
-> Allows a function or a data type to be written generically
-> Can handle values identically without depending on their type
-> a.k.a. generics or templates

POLYMORPHISM -> SUBTYPING
-> a.k.a. inclusion Polymorphism
-> Involves a super-subtype relationship

-> A Subtype always overrides a method from the super type
-> Polymorphic method

POLYMORPHISM> SUMMARY
Key points discussed in this video:
-> Polymorphism is a Greek term which means 'many forms
-> Polymorphism provides a single interface to different entities.
-> Ad hoc, Parametric and Subtyping are the three types of Polymorphism.
-> Parametric Polymorphism allows a function or a data type  to be written generically.
-> In Subtyping Polymorphism, the Subtype overrides a method from the super type.
