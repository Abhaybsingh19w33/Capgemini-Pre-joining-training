Introduction
Do-while loop is the best-chosen loop for the scenario
Executes the body of the loop at least one time

Overview
Do-while loop also known as post check while loop
-> Loop body is executed at least once
-> Subsequent iterations depend on the loop criteria
-> Useful when a menu selection or input validation is processed

Do-while Loop
It can be a boolean expressionlike age less than or equal to 18 or less than something
-> The results stored in boolean variable is called valid
-> If false is used then loop will come out of the loop always
-> If true is used loop acts like an infinite loop or endless loop

Preference
Do-while is the least preferred loop
-> Used when the number of iterations is not known. Initially, and users are not aware of the loop criteria

Alternatives
-> Use an infinite while or for loop, with a force-exit at the end of the loop

Summary
Key points discussed in this video:
-> Do-while loop guarantees the execution of the loop body at least one time
-> Alternatively infinite while or a far loop can also be used
-> It is the least preferred loop
