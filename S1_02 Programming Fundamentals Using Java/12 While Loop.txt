Introduction
To repeat the job code is executed again and again
-> Reading data one-by-one from a database table
-> Stop when there is no records

Overview
Basic working of while loop
-> Allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given boolean condition
-> Can be thought of as a repeating if statement
-> Condition gets executed evaluated repeatedly, until it becomes false

How It Works?
-> Consists of a block of code and a condition
-> Condition is evaluated, and if the condition is true, the code within the block is executed
-> This repeats until the condition becomes false: called pre-test loop

Boolean Always
-> Boolean expressions are always used in conditions
-> But in Java it will throw an error

Infinite Loop
Supplying a "true" to the while construct makes it an endless (infinite) loop

Summary
Key points discussed in this video
-> While loop is a code that gets executed repeatedy
-> While loop always requires a boolean expression
-> A true condition makes the loop an infinite one
