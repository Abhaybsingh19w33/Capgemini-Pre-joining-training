There are two types of numeric data:
Integers : byte, short, int, long
Decimals : float, double

Java is statically typed - Define a variable of a particular type

Declare variable and assign value
-> JavaScript
Create variable and assign value
-> PHP
-> VBScript
-> VB

Numeric Datatypes
-> A variable must be associated with a datatype known as statically typed
-> All variables must be declared before using
--> Datatype variable [ = initialValue];

Integers
-> Integers store the binary equivalent of the number
--> Example 307
Binary equivalent of 307 : 0000 0001 0011 0011

-> Negative numbers are stored in 2's complement format
--> example -310
0000 0001 0011 0110 (unsigned)
1111 1110 1100 1001 (1's complement)
1111 1110 1100 1010 (2's complement)

Size of each datatype differs
byte : 1 byte, -128 to 127
short : 2 bytes, -32768 to 32767
int : 4 bytes,-2147483648 to 2147483647
long : 8 bytes,-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807

Preference of integers is based on size
-> "int" is preferred
-> Java compilers and runtimes are tuned to work with int
-> In the heap, all integers have a default value of 0

Decimals look like int and long
float : 4 bytes, 1.4E-45 to 3.4028235E38
double : 8 bytes, 4.9E-324 to 1.7976931348623157E308

Preference are made to safe space
-> "double" is preferred
-> Java compilers and runtimes are tuned to work with int
-> In the heap, all decimals have a default value of 0.0

Summary
Key points discussed in this video:
-> Every variable must be declared
-> Integers store in the binary format
-> Numerical values in the heap is stored in zeros
