Introduction
It was introduced in Java 5, it is a uniform way of accessing the data
-> Simple structure
-> Simplifies the code


Overview
-> Simple structure
-> Simplify code
-> Enhances readability
-> Visit each element of an array/collection without explicitly expressing how one goes from element to element
-> Introduced with the Java SE 5

Syntax
The syntax uses the keyword (forage)
for (<datatype> <variable>: <collection>) {
    // process <variable>;
}

Example
The header has two parts separated by a colon
int []nums = (12, 23, 34, 56, 67, 78);

for (int num: nums) { // Datatype and variable
    System.out.println(num);
}

23
34
56
67
78

Example
Collection can be an array (including multi-dimensional), a list, set, or an iterator
for (int []row: nums) {
    for (int []cell : row)
        S.o.print (cell+"\t");
    S.o.p();
}
Output: // Arraylist
22  30  495 20
300 40  550 33 44 553
0   0   0   0

Comparison
In an enhanced for loop, string name, colon names are declared in header

String []names = {....}

for (int i=0; i < names.length; i++)
    String name = names [i];
    S.o.p("Hello, "+ name);

}
for (String name: names) {
    S.o.p("Hello, "+ name);
}

Comparison
List is a collection, array list, linked list or a vector

List<Employee> 1ist = {...}
for (int i=0, j=list.size (); i<j: i++){
    Employee emp list.get(i); // function to retreive individual list element
    emp.print();
}

// So the for loop for working with arrays and for loop for working with list remains same
for (Employee emp: list) {
    emp.print();
}

Comparison
Set can be hash set, tree set, etc.

List Employee> list = {...}
Iterator<Employee> it = list.iterator();
while (it.hasNext()){
    Employee emp = it.next();
    emp.print();
}

for (Employee emp: list) {
    emp.print();
}

Higher Abstraction Level
In higher abstraction level, low level details are not expressed 
-> The developer simply states that they want to loop and the language takes care of the rest

Disadvantages
Disadvantages of enhance for loop are:
-> All the benefit is lost as soon as the developer needs to access the index or to remove an item
-> More code is generated magically by the compiler

Summary
Key points discussed in this video:
-> Enhanced for loop is very simple in structure and uses simplÃ­fied code
-> Compiler adds a lot of code
