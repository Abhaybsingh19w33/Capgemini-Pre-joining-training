Q - Which of the following is incorrect regarding references?

Can be used as method arguments and return types
Can be assigned to another reference of similar type
Is initialised to null by default in the stack
Can not be used with operators such as arithmetic or relational operators

Ans -> The references in the method stack are not initialised to anything. Using such uninitialised rererences leads to compilation error

Q - Which of the following is not a primitive data type?
int

Q - Given: float f= 9.0; System.out.printn (f/(fioat)3);
What is the outpuÅ¥?
3
3.0
Compilation error
Runtime error

Ans - The literal 9.0 is treated as double and will Occupy 8 bytes in memory. It is then assigned to a 4 byte variable, which the compiler does not allow

1 bits
2 bits
8 bits
16 bits

Ans - Characters in Java stores the Unicode value of a character rather than the ASCII value. Unicode needs 2 bytes of storage.

!
~
^
&

-> >>>=
Ans - Short circuit operators must be of the format <op>= where <op> can be any binary operator.

Q - What is the output of given code?

int num = 7;
if(num%2){
    System.out.printin("'Even");
}
else {
    System.out.printin("Odd");
}

Even
Odd
Compiler error
Runtime error

Ans - The if statement requires a boolean expression or value.

Q - Which of the following is incorrect regarding references?

Given:
int a=15;
if(a<5)
    System.out.printin("less than 5");
else if(a<10)
    System.out.printin("less than 10");
    System.out.printin("'more than 5")
else
    System.out.printin('more than 10");

less than 5
less than 10 \n more than 5
more than 10
Error

Ans - Error

Q - The switch case statement in java can not work with
char
int
short
boolean

Ans - The switch statement can't take float, double and Boolean.

Q - In Java 1.7, the switch statement can also work with

float
String
double
boolean

Ans - In Java 1.7, 'switch' can take a String variable. Value (not reference) comparison is done and it is case sensitive.


Q -  The first expression in a for loop header is generally known as
expression1
loop intialiser
loop terminator
loop condition

Ans - The for loop header has 3 parts; initialiser, Condition and loop-control statements.

Q - How do you create an infinite for loop in Java?
for{}(/* statements */}
for{true}(/* statements */}
for{;;}(/* statements */}
for{;1;}(/* statements */}

Ans - Let us understand with the help of this example:
for(;;){
    if(n++ >100){
        break;
    }
    sum += n;
}

Q - Which of the following is the correct usage of the enhanced for loop?
Select the correct option and click Submit.
foreach(int n: intArray){}
foreach(int n in intArray)
for(int n: intArray)
for(int n in intArray)}

Ans - The actual syntax is.
for(<data type> <variable>, <collection>{
    // process <variable>;
}

Q - Is it true that the benefit is lost as soon as the developer needs to access the index or remove an item?

Yes
No

Correct
All the benefit is lost as soon as the developer needs to access tne index or remove an item.


Q - What is the output of given code?
Select the corect option and click Submit.
25
24
45
Error

Ans - The while loop expression must be a boolean unlike C or C++. So, the loop should look like: while(n-- >=0} {...}.

Q - Ihe do-while loop is generally preferred, when 

the loop criteria is known in advance
the number of iterations is fixed
an input needs to be validated before proceeding further
the loop has to iterate exactly once

Ans - Generally the do-while loop is used for simple menus and user input validations.

Q - In Java, yoOu cannot use to branch to a diferent part of the code.
a label
goto statement
method call

Ans - In Java, "goto" is a reserved word.

Q - Which of the following is incorrect regarding the break statement?

Terminates any labeled statement
Skips rest of the block
Continues with the statement following the block
Proceeds with the next iteration

Ans -  The "continue" proceeds with the next iteration and not the "break" statement

Q - Which of the following stops the execution of a method and transfers control back to the caller?

break
continue
return
goto

Ans - The "return" keyword is used to stop execution of a method and to transfer control back to the caller

Q - Which of the following is not a valid array declaration?

int []arr;
int []arr = new int[3];
Correct - int arr[] = {12, 34}

Ans - The array operator [] in the declaration can not be used to specify the size.

Q - What is the output?
Select the correct option and click Stubmit.
Given:
int [] arr;
arr={1,2, 3};
int sum = 0;
for(inti=0;i < arr.length;i++){
    sum+=arr[i];
    System.out.printin(sum);
}

0
6
1\n 3\n 6
Error - Correct

Ans - Assigning an array initialiser list to an array reference after declaration will result in an error.

Q - The array operatorI can not be used for_
declaring array types
specifying array size during initialisation
accessing array elements
specifying the size of the array during declaration

Ans - The array operator [] can not be used for specirying the size of the array during declaration. It is a compilation error.

a matrix of rows and columns
a single dimensional array of size R*C
Correct - a pointer to pointer in C language

Ans - It is also called as jagged arrays in C#.

Q - Which of the following is not true for String?

The String class implements immutable character strings
String objects are read-only once the string has been created and initialised

Correct
Calling toUpperCase() on a String object changes its
content to upper case

To work with dynamic character strings, use the StringBuffer class

Ans - Strings are immutable, and calling any method on a string object can not change its content

Q - Which of the following is not a compile-time constant expression?

String name = "Vinod";
String name = "Vin" + "od";

Correct
String name2 = name1+ "od";

Ans - The expression name1+ "od" is not a compile-time constant expression, since the value of "name1" is not known at the comple time.

Q - How do you create a Scanner instance representing the default console input?
Select the correct option and click Submit.

Scanner sc = new Scanner('console");
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
Scanner sc = new Scanner(DEFAULT_CONSOLE);
Scanner sc = new Scanner(CONSOLE);

Correct
We can create a Scanner object by invoking several different constructors. One such constructor is Scanner(Inputstream Source). System.in iS an instance of Inputstream that represent the default Console input.
