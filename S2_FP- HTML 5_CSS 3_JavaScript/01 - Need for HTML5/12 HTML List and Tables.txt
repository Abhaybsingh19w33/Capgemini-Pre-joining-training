HTML LISTS AND TABLES -> HTML LISTS
HTML HAS Support for three kinds of lists:
-> <ul> Unordered List: Displayed with bullets
-> <ol> Ordered List: Displayed in a numbered way
-> <dl> Definition List: Displayed like a dictionary

Unordered list is a collection of items that have no special order or sequence

It is represented using a <ul> tag

The items of an Unordered list have bullets

<ul>
    <li>    </li>
</ul>

Ordered list is a collection of items that have a sequence
It is represented using a <ol> tag
The items of an Ordered list are numbered

<ol> 
    <li></li>
</ol>

IN definition lists, entries are listed in the same way as they are lisited in a dictionary

The definition list is a way to present a glossary, a list of terms or any other aname/value list.

Definition list makes use of following tags
<dl> : defines the start of the list
<dt> : Used for a term
<dd> : used for term definition
</dl> : End of the list

<dl>
    <dt><b></b></dt>
    <dd></dd>
</dl>
