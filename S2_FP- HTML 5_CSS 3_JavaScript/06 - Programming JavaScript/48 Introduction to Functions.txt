INTRODUCTION TO FUNCTIONS -> INTRODUCTION

A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

INTRODUCTION TO FUNCTIONS -> WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
-> is a pieceof code in a program
-> is a block of organised, reusable code that is used to perfomr a single, related action
-> performs a specific task

Aa function:
-> can be assigned to variables
-> can be passed as arguments to other functions
-> provides better modularity

There are 2 basic types of functions
-> Built-in functions
-> User-defined functions

A function help to:
-> Reduce the duplication of the code
-> Decompse complex problems into sompler pieces
-> Improves the clarity of the code
-> Reuse the code

INTRODUCTION TO FUNCTIONS -> UNDERSTAND FUNCTIONS

A function is created woth the 'function' keyword.

Example

function name(parameter1, parameter2) {
    code can be executed
}

A function is executed only when it is called.

To call a function, specify the function name within the round brackets.

A function may contain variables, defined by var. Such variables are called local and are only visible inside the function.

Function Declarations are passed at pre-execution stage when the browser prepares to execute the code because of which the function declared can be called both after and before the definition.

Example 1
function sayHi (name) {
    alert ("Hi, "+name)
}
sayHi ("John")

Example 2
sayHi ("John")

function sayHi (name) {
    alert ("Hi, "+name)
}

A funcntion can return the value using return keyword.

A function can return only one value.

Multiple values can be returned from a function using an array or an object.

Example 1
function makeArray () {
    var myArray = new Array (4);
    myArray [0] = "A";
    myArray [1] = "B";
    myArray [2] = "C";
    myArray [3] = "D";
    return myArray;
}

Example 2
function BlockID () {
    var IDs = new object ();
    IDs['s'] = "Images/Block_01.png";
    IDs['g'] = "Images/Block_02.png";
    IDs['C'] = "Images/Block_03.png";
    IDs["d'] = "Images/Block_04.png";
    return IDs;
}

INTRODUCTION TO FUNCTIONS -> SUMMARY
Key points discussed in this video:
-> Functions make a program modular.
-> Functions are treated as objects.
