USING OPERATOR -> INTRODUCTION

JavaScript has support for Arithmetic Assignment, Bitwise and Logical operators.

USING OPERATOR -> ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
Types of assignment operators
=
+=
-=
*=
/=
>>=
<<= 
>>>=
&=
!=
^=

USING OPERATOR -> ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
Basic arithmetic operators
+
-
/
%

USING OPERATOR -> BITWISE OPERATORS
Bitwise operators treat numbers as signed 32-bit integers.

Unlike C language, bitwise operations are not very fast in JavaScript.

Bitwise operators supported by JavaScript.
&   AND
|   OR
^   XOR
~   NOT
<<  LEFT SHIFT
>>  RIGHT SHIFT
>>> ZERO FILL RIGHT SHIFT

USING OPERATOR -> LOGICAL OPERATORS
Like other programming languages, JavaScript provides boolean evaluations.

Logical operators supported by JavaScript.

&&  AND
||  OR
!   NOT
