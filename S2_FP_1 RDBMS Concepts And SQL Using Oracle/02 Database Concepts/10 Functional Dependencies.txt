FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCIES INTRODUCTION

-> Normalization is the process of decomposing larger data set or a table into smaller components or smaller tables

Normalization rules - 1nF, 2nF, 3nF

What are functional dependencies?

FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCIES -> DEFINITION
Functional Dependency 
-> Functional dependency (FD) is a constraint between two sets of attributes in a relation
--> Set of attributes

Set of attributes X in a relation R is said to functionally determine another attribute Y, also in R, if and only if each X value is associated with precisely one Y value

Example: X -> Y

FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCIES -> FD TYPES
There are three types of functional dependencies
-> Full Functional Dependency
-> Partial Functional Dependency
--> Attribute Y is partially dependent on attribute X if and only if it is dependent on the subset of attribute X
-> Transitive Dependency

FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCIES -> SUMMARY
Key points discussed in this video:

-> Functional dependency is a constraint between two sets of attributes in a relation

-> Set of attributes X in a relation R is said to functionally determine another attribute Y, also in R, if and only if each X value is associated with precisely one Y value

-> Attribute Y is partially dependent on attribute X if and
only if it is dependent on the subset of attribute X

-> Transitive dependency- If in a relation R, X -> Y and  Y -> Z, then X -> Z
