What is database system?

Database system is a Computerized record-keeping system

A simple database system does not have sophisticated software functionality

DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DBMS) DEFINITION
Set of software programs that control the organization, storage, management, and retrieval of data in a database

DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DBMS) > DBMS FUNCTIONS
-> Data management

-> Data definition
--> Storing customer related data in a format

-> Transaction Support
--> A logical set of activities

-> Concurrency Control
--> Multiple users can access data at the same time - Railway Ticket Reservation System
--> Throughput of the system is increased
--> If concurrency is not controlled, it could lead to data loss

-> Recovery mechanism
--> On a simple database, if there is a system crash, data recovery is not possible
--> DBMS provides functions to recover data
--> Data needs to be secure and integrity of data should be maintained
--> Same data should be reflected everywhere
--> For example, the same student's name should appear everywhere for the corresponding student ID

-> Security and Integrity
-> DBMS utilities
--> DBMS provides different utilities to export and import data in different formats


DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DBMS) BENEFITS OF DBMS
-> Enhanced security mechanism
-> Reduced data redundancy
-> Data independence
-> Sharing data across applications
-> Better flexibility
-> Enforce integrity Constraints
-> Backup and recovery features
-> Better transaction Support
-> Enforce standards

DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DBMS) SUMMARY
-> DBMS is a set of software programs that control the organization, storage, management, and retrieval of data in a database
