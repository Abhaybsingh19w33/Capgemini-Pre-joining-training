INTRODUCTION TO CORRELATED SUBQUERIES -> DESCRIPTION
What is correlated subquery?
-> Both inner and outer query are interdependent
-> For every row processed by the inner query, the outer query is processed as well
-> The inner query depends on the outer query before it can be processed
-> Condition(s) of the inner query accesses the table(s) of the outer query

INTRODUCTION TO CORRELATED SUBQUERIES -> EXISTS AND NOT EXISTS CLAUSES

-> EXISTS and NOT EXISTS are the two clauses that are commonly used in connection with correlated Subqueries

-> The EXISTS condition is set 'to be met' if the Subquery returns at least one row

-> The NOT EXISTS Condition is set 'to be met' if the Subquery returns no rows

Syntax
SELECT <Column list>
FROM <table list>
WHERE EXISTS (Sub-query);

INTRODUCTION TO CORRELATED SUBQUERIES -> SUMMARY
Key points discussed in this video:
-> In correlated subqueries, both inner and the outer queries are interdependent
-> For every row processed by the inner query, the outer query is processed as well
-> EXISTS and NOT EXISTS are the twoclauses that are commonly used in connection with correlated subqueries
