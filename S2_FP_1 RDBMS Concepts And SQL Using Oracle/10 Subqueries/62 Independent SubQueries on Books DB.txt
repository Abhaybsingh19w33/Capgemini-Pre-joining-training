INDEPENDENT SUBQUERIES ON BOOKS DB TABLES -> INTRODUCTION
-> While writing normal queries different conditions are used
-> But in some cases, values for conditions may not be specified
-> Such values can be acquired from some other query
-> Subquery

Subqueries: single Row Independent subquery demo
/*********************************************************/
Query to list the names and cost of most and least expensive books using single row independent sub query
/*********************************************************/

SELECT book_id, book_title, book_cost
FROM Books
WHERE book_cost = (SELECT MAX (book_cost) FROM Books)
OR book_cost = (SELECT MIN (book_cost) FROM Books);

Note:Any number of subaqueries can be present in the main query.

Inner query should only return one value as there should be only one operand each on either sides of the equal
to operator

Same holds good for other operators like <, >, <=, >=, !=
/*********************************************************/

Subqueries : Muilti-row Independent subquery demo
/*********************************************************/

Query to list the Publishers name who have supplied operating system books using multi-row independent
subquexy 
/*********************************************************/

SELECT publ_id, publ_name
FROM Publisher
WHERE publ_id IN
    (SELECT publ_id FROM Books WHERE book_type = 'OS')
ORDER BY publ_id;

Note: Here the inner query can return multiple rows; however each row should contain publ_id only

Same holds good for NOT IN clause also
