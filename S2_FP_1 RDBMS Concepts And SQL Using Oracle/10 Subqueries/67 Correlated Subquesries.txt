Upon completion of this module, you will be able to:
-> Use correlated subqueries in SQL.

1. Types of Independernt Subqueries

When subquery references a column from a table used in the parent query, it is a correlated subquery. In a correlated subquery, the subquery or the inner query is executed once for each row of the main query or the outer query. EXISTS or NOT EXISTS are the operators which are commonly used in correlated subqueries.

Following query retrieves rows from employees table who are working for marketing department.

SELECT first_name, manager_id, job_id
FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT employee_id FROM departments d
    WHERE d.department_id = e.department_id
    AND department_name = 'Marketing');

FIRST NAME          MANAGER ID      JOB ID
Michael             100             MK_MAN
Pat                 201             MK_REP

Above query uses EXTSTS operator. EXISTS returms TRUE if the subquery returms at least one row. The outer query returns the rows only if EXISTS evaluates to TRUE.

Following query lists the departments which do not have employees:

SELECT department_id, department_name
FROM departments d
WHERE NOT EXISTS
(SELECT employee_id FROM employees e WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id);

DEPTID  DEPARTMENT NAME
120     Treasury
130     Corporate Tax
140     Control and Credit
150     Shareholder Service

Above query uses NOT EXISTS operator. NOT EXISTS retums TRUE if the subquery does not return any row. The outer query returns the rows only if NOT EXISTS evaluates to TRUE.

Following query retrieves employees and lists maximum salary in the department to which that employee belongs, using a subquery in the SELECT clause.

SELECT First_name ||' '|| Last_name AS Full_Name,
salary, department_id deptid,  (SELECT MAX (salary) from employees b WHERE b.department_id = e.department_id) max_salary
FROM employees e
WHERE UPPER (last_name) LIKE 'K%';

FULL NAME       SALARY      DEPTID      MAX SALARY
Steven King     24000       90          24000
Neena           17000       90          24000
Alexander       3100        30          11000
Payam           7900        50          8200
Janette         10000       80          14000
Sundita         6100        80          14000
