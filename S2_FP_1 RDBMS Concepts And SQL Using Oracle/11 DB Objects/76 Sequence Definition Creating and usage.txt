SEQUENCE DEFINITION CREATING AND USAGE INTRODUCTION
Database Application
-> Programmer may need to create unique numbers continuously
-> Example: Bill number - In a retail shop, each purchase will have a unique bill number
-> Bill numbers may get duplicated

Integrity Constraint Violation
-> Database sequence

SEQUENCE DEFINITION CREATING AND USAGE -> DEFINITION
Database sequence
-> An object in Oracle used to generate a number sequence
-> Useful if unique numbers are required to generate primary keys

Need sequential algorithm
-> Bill Number
-> Order ID
-> Customer ID
-> Employee Number
-> Bank Account Number
-> Invoice Number

Do not need sequential algorithm
-> Debit Card Number
-> Credit Card Number

Database sequence
-> Used when inserting records to tables

CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_name
MINVALUE value
MAXVALUE value
START WITH value
INCREMENT BY value
CACHE value;

SEQUENCE DEFINITION CREATING AND USAGE -> CREATION
What happens when a sequence is created?
-> Applications can make use of the sequence every time
-> Increments CACHE value
-> Data is stored based on incremented CACHE value

Example
CREATE SEQUENCE bill_num_seq
MINVALUE 1
MAXVALUE 99999
START WITH 1000     --First bill number starts with 1000
INCREMENT BY 1
CACHE 20;           -- Stores value in memory after incrementing by 20

INSERT INTO BILLBOOK
VALUES (bill_num_seq.NEXTVAL,
Col2_value, col_3_value,... );

Use NEXTVAL instead of bill numbers

NEXTVAL increments work like autometer in vehicles
Used for primary key columns     

SEQUENCE DEFINITION CREATING AND USAGE -> SUMMARY
Key points discussed in this video:
-> Database sequence is an object in Oracle that is used to generate a number sequence
-> It is useful when unique numbers are required for columns, especially primary keys
