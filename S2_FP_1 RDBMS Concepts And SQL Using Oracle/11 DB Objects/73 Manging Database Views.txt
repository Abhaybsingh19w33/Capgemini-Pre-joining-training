MANAGING DATABASE VIEWS -> INTRODUCTION
Database

-> Multiple programmers can log into database
-> Administrator may need to provide a programmer access to a confidential table

Example:
Employee table that has confidential data such as date
of birth, salary, and commission details

Administrator needs to provide access to some programmers while restricting access to others
-> Database Views

MANAGING DATABASE VIEWS -> OVERVIEW
-> A view is a 'virtual table'
-> This table does not have its own data
-> View contents are defined by a query as
given below
SELECT book_id, book_title, book_edition
FROM Books
WHERE book_type = 'DB';

-> Underlying tables are referred to as 'base tables'
-> Only query is stored in the database, not its data
-> The underlying query of the view gets executed every time a view is used
-> Separate permissions on views can be granted to other users so as to hide confidential data from the base tables

How to create a view?

Example
CREATE VIEW Book_View AS
SELECT book_title, book_type, publ_id
FROM Books
WHERE book_type = 'DB';

Book view is mentioned in place of a table view

SELECT book_title, book_type
FROM Book_View
WHERE publ_id = 10;

The view provides access only t0 columns such as book title, book type, and publisher ID

SELECT book_id
FROM Book_View
WHERE publ_id = 10;
The book ID is not part of the view created. Therefore, it throws error 'Invalid ldentified'

MANAGING DATABASE VIEWS -> CREATING VIEW
Can only one table be included in the FROM clause?
-> Any number of tables can be included in FROM clause

Example
CREATE VIEW Book_Publisher_View AS
SELECT b.book_id, b.book_title, p.publ_name
FROM Books b, Publisher p 
WHERE b.publ_id = p.publ_id;

MANAGING DATABASE VIEWS -> AN UPDATABLE VIEW
A view is updatable if the query that defines it meets all these restrictions:

Views that meet these conditions are updatable

-> DISTINCT is not specified
-> FROM clause must specify only one updatable table
-> SELECT list cannot contain expressions, calculated columns, or column functions
-> WHERE clause must not include a subquery
-> Should not include GROUP BY or HAVING or WITH READ ONLY clauses

MANAGING DATABASE VIEWS -> ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES

ADVANTAGES
Security: Can restrict rows columns to be viewable only to certain users

Information hiding: Original schema name, table name can be hidden from user

Simplification of query: Complex queries underlying a view are simplified for user

DISADVANTAGES
Performance issues: Every time a view is called, its underlying query is executed. Performance issues will Surface if the query is Complex

Restrictions: Not all views are updatable


MANAGING DATABASE VIEWS -> SUMMARY
Key points discussed in this video:

-> A view is a virtual table which does not have its own data
-> A view is created using a SELECT statement which gets executed every time the view is used
-> A view is updatable if the query that defines the view meets certain conditionsS
-> Original schema name, table name can be hidden from users view and complex queries underlying a view are simplified for the user
