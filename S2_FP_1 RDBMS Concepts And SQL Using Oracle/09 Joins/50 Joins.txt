JOINS -> DEFINITION

-> A join is used to query data from two or more tables
-> It relies on the relationship between columns of tables

The common attribute helps to join back the tables to form the original table

JOINS -> INNER JOIN
-> Tables in a database are often related to each other with common columns
-> Two or more tables are joined based on common columns
-> Names of common columns may not be the same
-> If N tables are being joined, there would be N-1 joining statements

Syntax for joining tables

SELECT <column_name(s)>
    FROM <table_name1>
INNER JOIN <table_name2>
    ON <table_name1.column_name> = <table_name2.column_name>

[INNER JOIN <table_name3>

    ON <table_name2.column_name> = <table_name3.column_name>
    ... and so on.]

WHERE <condition(s)> ] 
-> Use WHERE condition to filter out certain rows

JOINS -> CARTESIAN PRODUCT JOIN
-> Default join method used by database, if inner join is not specified
-> Every row of one table is paired with every row in the second table
-> Happens when relationship between two tables is not defined or there is no common column between them

JOINS -> SUMMARY
Key points discussed in this video:

-> A join is used to query data from two or more tables. It reles on relationship between columns of tables
-> Inner join joins two or more tables to query data from them
-> Cartesian product join is the default join method used by the database, if inner join is not specified
-> Cartesian join is used to generate large number of rows for testing
