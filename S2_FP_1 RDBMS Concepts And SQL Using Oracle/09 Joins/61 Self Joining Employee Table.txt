Example: self Joln

Show employee id and names of employees and their corresponding managers :

SELECT emp.employee_id, emp.first_name, mgr.employee_id, mgr.first_name
FROM Employees emp, Employees mgr
WHERE emp.manager_id = mgr.employee_id
ORDER BY mgr.employee_id, emp.employee_id;

Join the table with itself to retrieve the 'first name' of the managers

Example: Self Join
List customers and book ids which were bought along with 'B0001'

SELECT s1.cust_id, s2.book_id
FROM book_sales s1, book_sales s2
wHERE S1.book_id = 'B0001'
AND s1.book_id <> s2.book_id    --To avoid BOO01 also getting displayed in the output
AND s1.cust_id = s2.cust_id     --To get customers who bought book 'B0001'
ORDER BY 1, 2;
