OUTER JOINS -> DEFINITION
-> Used when matched rows from one table and all rows (including unmatched) are required from other table(s)

Left Outer Join:
-> Returns all rows from the left table (Table A), even if there are no matches in the right table (Table B)
-> Retrieves rows from right table (Table B), that match based on common key
-> For non-matching rows, only left table columns are retrieved, with right table columns as null

SYNTAX
SELECT <column_name(s)>
FROM <table_name1>
LEFT [OUTER] JOIN <table_name2>
    ON table_name1.column_name = table_name2.column_name
[LEFT [OUTER] JOIN <table_name3>
    ON table_name2.column_name = table_name3.column_name
...]
[WHERE <condition(s)>]  



OUTER JOINS -> RIGHT OUTER JOIN
-> Returns all rows from the right table (Table B), even if there are no matches in the left table (Table A)

-> Retrieves rows from left table (Table A) that match based on common key

-> For non-matching rows, only right table columns are retrieved, with left table columns as NULL

SYNTAX

SELECT <Column_name(s)>
FROM <table_name1>
RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN <table_name2>
    ON table_name1.column_name = table_name2.column_name
RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN <table_name3>
    ON table_name2.column_name = table_name3.column_name
...
[WHERE <condition(s)>]


OUTER JOINS -> SUMMARY
Key points discussed in this video:
-> Outer join is used when matched rows from one table and all (including unmatched) rows are required from other table(s)
-> Outer joins are of two types: Left Outer Join and Right Outer Join
-> Left Outer Join returns matched rows from both tables and unmatched rows from the left table
-> Right Outer Join returns matched rows from both tables and unmatched rows from the right table
