Python is a multi-paradigm programming language invented by Guido Van Rossum.

WHAT IS PYTHON? -> CHARACTERISTICS

Python:
-> is a high-level, procedural/structured and an object oriented programming language
-> is functional, imperative, and reflective in nature
-> is aspect oriented

Python supports:
-> Dynamic typing
-> Cross platform development
-> Structured Exception Handling (SEH)
-> Multithreading
-> Sockets
-> GUI
-> Database programming

Python's objective is to emphasise on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code as compared to other languages such as C++ or Java.
