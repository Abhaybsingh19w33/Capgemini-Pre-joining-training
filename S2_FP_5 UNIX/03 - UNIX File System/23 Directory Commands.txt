Organizing files bring order to our thoughts.

DIRECTORY COMMANDS -> DISK LAYOUT OF FILES
-> File data in blocks
-> File properties in inode
-> A directory maps filenames to inode numbers

DIRECTORY COMMANDS -> DIRECTORY STORAGE
Inode
-> Stores file attributes
-> Points to the start of file data on disk
-> Unique inode number for each file
-> Lacks file name
-> A directory maps filename to inode numbers

DIRECTORY COMMANDS -> DIRECTORY OPERATIONS
-> Creating a directory
-> Navigating to a directory
-> Removing a directory

DIRECTORY COMMANDS -> CREATE DIRECTORY

mkdir [options] directoryname
-> mkdir Projects
-> mkdir ../Pictures/Convocation
-> mkdir -p Projects/telco/switch
-> mkdir {src, include, objects}

DIRECTORY COMMANDS > NAVIGATE TO A DIRECTORY
cd [options] directoryname
-> cd Projects
-> cd . ./Pictures/Convocation
-> cd /home/stanley/Projects/source
-> cd
-> cd -

DIRECTORY COMMANDS -> REMOVE A DIRECTORY
rmdir [options] directoryname
-> rmdir temp
-> rmdir -p bad/temp

DIRECTORY COMMANDS -> SUMMARY
Key points discussed in this video:
-> A directory maps filenames to inode numbers.
-> mkdir command is used to create a directory.
-> cd command, by detault, navigates to the home directory.
-> rmdir command removes an empty directory.
