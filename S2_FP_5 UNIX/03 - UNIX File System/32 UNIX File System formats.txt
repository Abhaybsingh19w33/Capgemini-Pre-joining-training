Persistant storage makes UNIX a robust system.

FILE SYSTEM FORMATS -> DISKS storage
-> PARTITIONS
-> File System
--> ext2
--> ext4
--> reiserfs
-> Mounting file systems

File system formats -> free disk space
df [options] [filename]
-> df
-> df -t <file system type>
-> df -k
-> df -h

File system formats -> disk usage statistics
du [options] [filename]
-> du /home/joe
-> du -c
-> df -k
-> df -h
-> du -s

FILE SYSTEM FORMATS -> SUMMARY
Key points discussed in this video:
-> UNIX uses a very scalable architecture to represent its files.
-> di -kh provides information on free disk space available on each file system in a human readable format.
-> du -khs can be used to find out the files that use the maximum amount of disk space.
